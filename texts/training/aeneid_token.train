[THE AENEID by Virgil<SPLIT>]
BOOK I
Arms<SPLIT>, and the man I sing<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, forc'd by fate<SPLIT>, And haughty Juno<SPLIT>'s unrelenting hate<SPLIT>, Expell'd and exil'd<SPLIT>, left the Trojan shore<SPLIT>. Long labors<SPLIT>, both by sea and land<SPLIT>, he bore<SPLIT>, And in the doubtful war<SPLIT>, before he won The Latian realm<SPLIT>, and built the destin'd town<SPLIT>; His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine<SPLIT>, And settled sure succession in his line<SPLIT>, From whence the race of Alban fathers come<SPLIT>, And the long glories of majestic Rome<SPLIT>.
O<SPLIT>Muse<SPLIT>! the causes and the crimes relate<SPLIT>; What goddess was provok'd<SPLIT>, and whence her hate<SPLIT>; For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began To persecute so brave<SPLIT>, so just a man<SPLIT>; Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares<SPLIT>, Expos'd to wants<SPLIT>, and hurried into wars<SPLIT>! Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show<SPLIT>, Or exercise their spite in human woe<SPLIT>?
Against the Tiber<SPLIT>'s mouth<SPLIT>, but far away<SPLIT>, An ancient town was seated on the sea<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>Tyrian colony<SPLIT>; the people made Stout for the war<SPLIT>, and studious of their trade<SPLIT>: Carthage the name<SPLIT>; belov'd by Juno more Than her own Argos<SPLIT>, or the Samian shore<SPLIT>. Here stood her chariot<SPLIT>; here<SPLIT>, if Heav'n were kind<SPLIT>, The seat of awful empire she design'd<SPLIT>. Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Long cited by the people of the sky<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) That times to come should see the Trojan race Her Carthage ruin<SPLIT>, and her tow'rs deface<SPLIT>; Nor thus confin'd<SPLIT>, the yoke of sov'reign sway Should on the necks of all the nations lay<SPLIT>. She ponder'd this<SPLIT>, and fear'd it was in fate<SPLIT>; Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, long causes working in her mind<SPLIT>, And secret seeds of envy<SPLIT>, lay behind<SPLIT>; Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd Of partial Paris<SPLIT>, and her form disdain'd<SPLIT>; The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed<SPLIT>, Electra<SPLIT>'s glories<SPLIT>, and her injur'd bed<SPLIT>. Each was a cause alone<SPLIT>; and all combin'd To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind<SPLIT>. For this<SPLIT>, far distant from the Latian coast She drove the remnants of the Trojan host<SPLIT>; And sev'n long years th<SPLIT>' unhappy wand<SPLIT>'ring train Were toss'd by storms<SPLIT>, and scatter'd thro<SPLIT>' the main<SPLIT>. Such time<SPLIT>, such toil<SPLIT>, requir'd the Roman name<SPLIT>, Such length of labor for so vast a frame<SPLIT>.
Now scarce the Trojan fleet<SPLIT>, with sails and oars<SPLIT>, Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores<SPLIT>, Ent<SPLIT>'ring with cheerful shouts the wat<SPLIT>'ry reign<SPLIT>, And plowing frothy furrows in the main<SPLIT>; When<SPLIT>, lab'ring still with endless discontent<SPLIT>, The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>Then am I vanquish'd<SPLIT>? must I yield<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" said she<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>And must the Trojans reign in Italy<SPLIT>? So Fate will have it<SPLIT>, and Jove adds his force<SPLIT>; Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course<SPLIT>. Could angry Pallas<SPLIT>, with revengeful spleen<SPLIT>, The Grecian navy burn<SPLIT>, and drown the men<SPLIT>? She<SPLIT>, for the fault of one offending foe<SPLIT>, The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw<SPLIT>: With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship<SPLIT>, And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, as an eagle gripes the trembling game<SPLIT>, The wretch<SPLIT>, yet hissing with her father<SPLIT>'s flame<SPLIT>, She strongly seiz'd<SPLIT>, and with a burning wound Transfix'd<SPLIT>, and naked<SPLIT>, on a rock she bound<SPLIT>. But I<SPLIT>, who walk in awful state above<SPLIT>, The majesty of heav'n<SPLIT>, the sister wife of Jove<SPLIT>, For length of years my fruitless force employ Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy<SPLIT>! What nations now to Juno<SPLIT>'s pow'r will pray<SPLIT>, Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>"
Thus rag'd the goddess<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, with fury fraught<SPLIT>. The restless regions of the storms she sought<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>, in a spacious cave of living stone<SPLIT>, The tyrant Aeolus<SPLIT>, from his airy throne<SPLIT>, With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds<SPLIT>, And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds<SPLIT>. This way and that th<SPLIT>' impatient captives tend<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, pressing for release<SPLIT>, the mountains rend<SPLIT>. High in his hall th<SPLIT>' undaunted monarch stands<SPLIT>, And shakes his scepter<SPLIT>, and their rage commands<SPLIT>; Which did he not<SPLIT>, their unresisted sway Would sweep the world before them in their way<SPLIT>; Earth<SPLIT>, air<SPLIT>, and seas thro<SPLIT>' empty space would roll<SPLIT>, And heav'n would fly before the driving soul<SPLIT>. In fear of this<SPLIT>, the Father of the Gods Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes<SPLIT>, And lock'd 'em safe within<SPLIT>, oppress'd with mountain loads<SPLIT>; Impos'd a king<SPLIT>, with arbitrary sway<SPLIT>, To loose their fetters<SPLIT>, or their force allay<SPLIT>. To whom the suppliant queen her pray<SPLIT>'rs address'd<SPLIT>, And thus the tenor of her suit express'd<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>O Aeolus<SPLIT>! for to thee the King of Heav'n The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n<SPLIT>; Thy force alone their fury can restrain<SPLIT>, And smooth the waves<SPLIT>, or swell the troubled main- A<SPLIT>race of wand<SPLIT>'ring slaves<SPLIT>, abhorr'd by me<SPLIT>, With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea<SPLIT>; To fruitful Italy their course they steer<SPLIT>, And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there<SPLIT>. Raise all thy winds<SPLIT>; with night involve the skies<SPLIT>; Sink or disperse my fatal enemies<SPLIT>. Twice sev'n<SPLIT>, the charming daughters of the main<SPLIT>, Around my person wait<SPLIT>, and bear my train<SPLIT>: Succeed my wish<SPLIT>, and second my design<SPLIT>; The fairest<SPLIT>, Deiopeia<SPLIT>, shall be thine<SPLIT>, And make thee father of a happy line<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
To this the god<SPLIT>: "'T is yours<SPLIT>, O queen<SPLIT>, to will The work which duty binds me to fulfil<SPLIT>. These airy kingdoms<SPLIT>, and this wide command<SPLIT>, Are all the presents of your bounteous hand<SPLIT>: Yours is my sov'reign<SPLIT>'s grace<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, as your guest<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>sit with gods at their celestial feast<SPLIT>; Raise tempests at your pleasure<SPLIT>, or subdue<SPLIT>; Dispose of empire<SPLIT>, which I hold from you<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>, and hurl'd against the mountain side His quiv'ring spear<SPLIT>, and all the god applied<SPLIT>. The raging winds rush thro<SPLIT>' the hollow wound<SPLIT>, And dance aloft in air<SPLIT>, and skim along the ground<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, settling on the sea<SPLIT>, the surges sweep<SPLIT>, Raise liquid mountains<SPLIT>, and disclose the deep<SPLIT>. South<SPLIT>, East<SPLIT>, and West with mix'd confusion roar<SPLIT>, And roll the foaming billows to the shore<SPLIT>. The cables crack<SPLIT>; the sailors<SPLIT>' fearful cries Ascend<SPLIT>; and sable night involves the skies<SPLIT>; And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes<SPLIT>. Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue<SPLIT>; Then flashing fires the transient light renew<SPLIT>; The face of things a frightful image bears<SPLIT>, And present death in various forms appears<SPLIT>. Struck with unusual fright<SPLIT>, the Trojan chief<SPLIT>, With lifted hands and eyes<SPLIT>, invokes relief<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>Thrice and four times happy those<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he cried<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>That under Ilian walls before their parents died<SPLIT>! Tydides<SPLIT>, bravest of the Grecian train<SPLIT>! Why could not I by that strong arm be slain<SPLIT>, And lie by noble Hector on the plain<SPLIT>, Or great Sarpedon<SPLIT>, in those bloody fields Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields Of heroes<SPLIT>, whose dismember'd hands yet bear The dart aloft<SPLIT>, and clench the pointed spear<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails<SPLIT>, Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails<SPLIT>, And rent the sheets<SPLIT>; the raging billows rise<SPLIT>, And mount the tossing vessels to the skies<SPLIT>: Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow<SPLIT>; The galley gives her side<SPLIT>, and turns her prow<SPLIT>; While those astern<SPLIT>, descending down the steep<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' gaping waves behold the boiling deep<SPLIT>. Three ships were hurried by the southern blast<SPLIT>, And on the secret shelves with fury cast<SPLIT>. Those hidden rocks th<SPLIT>' Ausonian sailors knew<SPLIT>: They call'd them Altars<SPLIT>, when they rose in view<SPLIT>, And show'd their spacious backs above the flood<SPLIT>. Three more fierce Eurus<SPLIT>, in his angry mood<SPLIT>, Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand<SPLIT>, And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland<SPLIT>. Orontes<SPLIT>' bark<SPLIT>, that bore the Lycian crew<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>A horrid sight<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>) ev'n in the hero<SPLIT>'s view<SPLIT>, From stem to stern by waves was overborne<SPLIT>: The trembling pilot<SPLIT>, from his rudder torn<SPLIT>, Was headlong hurl'd<SPLIT>; thrice round the ship was toss'd<SPLIT>, Then bulg'd at once<SPLIT>, and in the deep was lost<SPLIT>; And here and there above the waves were seen Arms<SPLIT>, pictures<SPLIT>, precious goods<SPLIT>, and floating men<SPLIT>. The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way<SPLIT>, And suck'd thro<SPLIT>' loosen'd planks the rushing sea<SPLIT>. Ilioneus was her chief<SPLIT>: Alethes old<SPLIT>, Achates faithful<SPLIT>, Abas young and bold<SPLIT>, Endur'd not less<SPLIT>; their ships<SPLIT>, with gaping seams<SPLIT>, Admit the deluge of the briny streams<SPLIT>.
Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound Of raging billows breaking on the ground<SPLIT>. Displeas'd<SPLIT>, and fearing for his wat<SPLIT>'ry reign<SPLIT>, He rear'd his awful head above the main<SPLIT>, Serene in majesty<SPLIT>; then roll'd his eyes Around the space of earth<SPLIT>, and seas<SPLIT>, and skies<SPLIT>. He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd<SPLIT>, distress'd<SPLIT>, By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd<SPLIT>. Full well the god his sister<SPLIT>'s envy knew<SPLIT>, And what her aims and what her arts pursue<SPLIT>. He summon'd Eurus and the western blast<SPLIT>, And first an angry glance on both he cast<SPLIT>; Then thus rebuk'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Audacious winds<SPLIT>! from whence This bold attempt<SPLIT>, this rebel insolence<SPLIT>? Is it for you to ravage seas and land<SPLIT>, Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command<SPLIT>? To raise such mountains on the troubled main<SPLIT>? Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain<SPLIT>; And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign<SPLIT>. Hence<SPLIT>! to your lord my royal mandate bear- The realms of ocean and the fields of air Are mine<SPLIT>, not his<SPLIT>. By fatal lot to me The liquid empire fell<SPLIT>, and trident of the sea<SPLIT>. His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd<SPLIT>: There let him reign<SPLIT>, the jailer of the wind<SPLIT>, With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call<SPLIT>, And boast and bluster in his empty hall<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He spoke<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, while he spoke<SPLIT>, he smooth'd the sea<SPLIT>, Dispell'd the darkness<SPLIT>, and restor'd the day<SPLIT>. Cymothoe<SPLIT>, Triton<SPLIT>, and the sea-green train Of beauteous nymphs<SPLIT>, the daughters of the main<SPLIT>, Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands<SPLIT>: The god himself with ready trident stands<SPLIT>, And opes the deep<SPLIT>, and spreads the moving sands<SPLIT>; Then heaves them off the shoals<SPLIT>. Where<SPLIT>'er he guides His finny coursers and in triumph rides<SPLIT>, The waves unruffle and the sea subsides<SPLIT>. As<SPLIT>, when in tumults rise th<SPLIT>' ignoble crowd<SPLIT>, Mad are their motions<SPLIT>, and their tongues are loud<SPLIT>; And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly<SPLIT>, And all the rustic arms that fury can supply<SPLIT>: If then some grave and pious man appear<SPLIT>, They hush their noise<SPLIT>, and lend a list<SPLIT>'ning ear<SPLIT>; He soothes with sober words their angry mood<SPLIT>, And quenches their innate desire of blood<SPLIT>: So<SPLIT>, when the Father of the Flood appears<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears<SPLIT>, Their fury falls<SPLIT>: he skims the liquid plains<SPLIT>, High on his chariot<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, with loosen'd reins<SPLIT>, Majestic moves along<SPLIT>, and awful peace maintains<SPLIT>. The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars To nearest land<SPLIT>, and make the Libyan shores<SPLIT>.
Within a long recess there lies a bay<SPLIT>: An island shades it from the rolling sea<SPLIT>, And forms a port secure for ships to ride<SPLIT>; Broke by the jutting land<SPLIT>, on either side<SPLIT>, In double streams the briny waters glide<SPLIT>. Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene Appears above<SPLIT>, and groves for ever green<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>grot is form'd beneath<SPLIT>, with mossy seats<SPLIT>, To rest the Nereids<SPLIT>, and exclude the heats<SPLIT>. Down thro<SPLIT>' the crannies of the living walls The crystal streams descend in murm<SPLIT>'ring falls<SPLIT>: No haulsers need to bind the vessels here<SPLIT>, Nor bearded anchors<SPLIT>; for no storms they fear<SPLIT>. Sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet<SPLIT>, The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet<SPLIT>. The Trojans<SPLIT>, worn with toils<SPLIT>, and spent with woes<SPLIT>, Leap on the welcome land<SPLIT>, and seek their wish'd repose<SPLIT>.
First<SPLIT>, good Achates<SPLIT>, with repeated strokes Of clashing flints<SPLIT>, their hidden fire provokes<SPLIT>: Short flame succeeds<SPLIT>; a bed of wither'd leaves The dying sparkles in their fall receives<SPLIT>: Caught into life<SPLIT>, in fiery fumes they rise<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, fed with stronger food<SPLIT>, invade the skies<SPLIT>. The Trojans<SPLIT>, dropping wet<SPLIT>, or stand around The cheerful blaze<SPLIT>, or lie along the ground<SPLIT>: Some dry their corn<SPLIT>, infected with the brine<SPLIT>, Then grind with marbles<SPLIT>, and prepare to dine<SPLIT>. Aeneas climbs the mountain<SPLIT>'s airy brow<SPLIT>, And takes a prospect of the seas below<SPLIT>, If Capys thence<SPLIT>, or Antheus he could spy<SPLIT>, Or see the streamers of Caicus fly<SPLIT>. No vessels were in view<SPLIT>; but<SPLIT>, on the plain<SPLIT>, Three beamy stags command a lordly train Of branching heads<SPLIT>: the more ignoble throng Attend their stately steps<SPLIT>, and slowly graze along<SPLIT>. He stood<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, while secure they fed below<SPLIT>, He took the quiver and the trusty bow Achates us'd to bear<SPLIT>: the leaders first He laid along<SPLIT>, and then the vulgar pierc'd<SPLIT>; Nor ceas'd his arrows<SPLIT>, till the shady plain Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain<SPLIT>. For the sev'n ships he made an equal share<SPLIT>, And to the port return'd<SPLIT>, triumphant from the war<SPLIT>. The jars of gen'rous wine (<SPLIT>Acestes<SPLIT>' gift<SPLIT>, When his Trinacrian shores the navy left<SPLIT>) He set abroach<SPLIT>, and for the feast prepar'd<SPLIT>, In equal portions with the ven<SPLIT>'son shar'd<SPLIT>. Thus while he dealt it round<SPLIT>, the pious chief With cheerful words allay'd the common grief<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Endure<SPLIT>, and conquer<SPLIT>! Jove will soon dispose To future good our past and present woes<SPLIT>. With me<SPLIT>, the rocks of Scylla you have tried<SPLIT>; Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied<SPLIT>. What greater ills hereafter can you bear<SPLIT>? Resume your courage and dismiss your care<SPLIT>, An hour will come<SPLIT>, with pleasure to relate Your sorrows past<SPLIT>, as benefits of Fate<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' various hazards and events<SPLIT>, we move To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove<SPLIT>. Call'd to the seat (<SPLIT>the promise of the skies<SPLIT>) Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise<SPLIT>, Endure the hardships of your present state<SPLIT>; Live<SPLIT>, and reserve yourselves for better fate<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
These words he spoke<SPLIT>, but spoke not from his heart<SPLIT>; His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart<SPLIT>. The jolly crew<SPLIT>, unmindful of the past<SPLIT>, The quarry share<SPLIT>, their plenteous dinner haste<SPLIT>. Some strip the skin<SPLIT>; some portion out the spoil<SPLIT>; The limbs<SPLIT>, yet trembling<SPLIT>, in the caldrons boil<SPLIT>; Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil<SPLIT>. Stretch'd on the grassy turf<SPLIT>, at ease they dine<SPLIT>, Restore their strength with meat<SPLIT>, and cheer their souls with wine<SPLIT>. Their hunger thus appeas'd<SPLIT>, their care attends The doubtful fortune of their absent friends<SPLIT>: Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess<SPLIT>, Whether to deem 'em dead<SPLIT>, or in distress<SPLIT>. Above the rest<SPLIT>, Aeneas mourns the fate Of brave Orontes<SPLIT>, and th<SPLIT>' uncertain state Of Gyas<SPLIT>, Lycus<SPLIT>, and of Amycus<SPLIT>. The day<SPLIT>, but not their sorrows<SPLIT>, ended thus<SPLIT>.
When<SPLIT>, from aloft<SPLIT>, almighty Jove surveys Earth<SPLIT>, air<SPLIT>, and shores<SPLIT>, and navigable seas<SPLIT>, At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes<SPLIT>- Whom<SPLIT>, pond<SPLIT>'ring thus on human miseries<SPLIT>, When Venus saw<SPLIT>, she with a lowly look<SPLIT>, Not free from tears<SPLIT>, her heav'nly sire bespoke<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>O King of Gods and Men<SPLIT>! whose awful hand Disperses thunder on the seas and land<SPLIT>, Disposing all with absolute command<SPLIT>; How could my pious son thy pow'r incense<SPLIT>? Or what<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! is vanish'd Troy<SPLIT>'s offense<SPLIT>? Our hope of Italy not only lost<SPLIT>, On various seas by various tempests toss'd<SPLIT>, But shut from ev'ry shore<SPLIT>, and barr'd from ev'ry coast<SPLIT>. You promis'd once<SPLIT>, a progeny divine Of Romans<SPLIT>, rising from the Trojan line<SPLIT>, In after times should hold the world in awe<SPLIT>, And to the land and ocean give the law<SPLIT>. How is your doom revers'd<SPLIT>, which eas'd my care When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war<SPLIT>? Then fates to fates I could oppose<SPLIT>; but now<SPLIT>, When Fortune still pursues her former blow<SPLIT>, What can I hope<SPLIT>? What worse can still succeed<SPLIT>? What end of labors has your will decreed<SPLIT>? Antenor<SPLIT>, from the midst of Grecian hosts<SPLIT>, Could pass secure<SPLIT>, and pierce th<SPLIT>' Illyrian coasts<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>, rolling down the steep<SPLIT>, Timavus raves And thro<SPLIT>' nine channels disembogues his waves<SPLIT>. At length he founded Padua<SPLIT>'s happy seat<SPLIT>, And gave his Trojans a secure retreat<SPLIT>; There fix'd their arms<SPLIT>, and there renew'd their name<SPLIT>, And there in quiet rules<SPLIT>, and crown'd with fame<SPLIT>. But we<SPLIT>, descended from your sacred line<SPLIT>, Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine<SPLIT>, Are banish'd earth<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, for the wrath of one<SPLIT>, Remov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne<SPLIT>. Are these our scepters<SPLIT>? these our due rewards<SPLIT>? And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>"
To whom the Father of th<SPLIT>' immortal race<SPLIT>, Smiling with that serene indulgent face<SPLIT>, With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies<SPLIT>, First gave a holy kiss<SPLIT>; then thus replies<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>Daughter<SPLIT>, dismiss thy fears<SPLIT>; to thy desire The fates of thine are fix'd<SPLIT>, and stand entire<SPLIT>. Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, ripe for heav'n<SPLIT>, when fate Aeneas calls<SPLIT>, Then shalt thou bear him up<SPLIT>, sublime<SPLIT>, to me<SPLIT>: No councils have revers'd my firm decree<SPLIT>. And<SPLIT>, lest new fears disturb thy happy state<SPLIT>, Know<SPLIT>, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate<SPLIT>: Thy son (<SPLIT>nor is th<SPLIT>' appointed season far<SPLIT>) In Italy shall wage successful war<SPLIT>, Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field<SPLIT>, And sov'reign laws impose<SPLIT>, and cities build<SPLIT>, Till<SPLIT>, after ev'ry foe subdued<SPLIT>, the sun Thrice thro<SPLIT>' the signs his annual race shall run<SPLIT>: This is his time prefix'd<SPLIT>. Ascanius then<SPLIT>, Now call'd Iulus<SPLIT>, shall begin his reign<SPLIT>. He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear<SPLIT>, Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, with hard labor<SPLIT>, Alba Longa build<SPLIT>. The throne with his succession shall be fill'd Three hundred circuits more<SPLIT>: then shall be seen Ilia the fair<SPLIT>, a priestess and a queen<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, full of Mars<SPLIT>, in time<SPLIT>, with kindly throes<SPLIT>, Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose<SPLIT>. The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain<SPLIT>: Then Romulus his grandsire<SPLIT>'s throne shall gain<SPLIT>, Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become<SPLIT>, The people Romans call<SPLIT>, the city Rome<SPLIT>. To them no bounds of empire I assign<SPLIT>, Nor term of years to their immortal line<SPLIT>. Ev'n haughty Juno<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, with endless broils<SPLIT>, Earth<SPLIT>, seas<SPLIT>, and heav'n<SPLIT>, and Jove himself turmoils<SPLIT>; At length aton'd<SPLIT>, her friendly pow'r shall join<SPLIT>, To cherish and advance the Trojan line<SPLIT>. The subject world shall Rome<SPLIT>'s dominion own<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, prostrate<SPLIT>, shall adore the nation of the gown<SPLIT>. An age is ripening in revolving fate When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state<SPLIT>, And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call<SPLIT>, To crush the people that conspir'd her fall<SPLIT>. Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise<SPLIT>, Whose empire ocean<SPLIT>, and whose fame the skies Alone shall bound<SPLIT>; whom<SPLIT>, fraught with eastern spoils<SPLIT>, Our heav'n<SPLIT>, the just reward of human toils<SPLIT>, Securely shall repay with rites divine<SPLIT>; And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine<SPLIT>. Then dire debate and impious war shall cease<SPLIT>, And the stern age be soften'd into peace<SPLIT>: Then banish'd Faith shall once again return<SPLIT>, And Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn<SPLIT>; And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain The righteous laws<SPLIT>, and fraud and force restrain<SPLIT>. Janus himself before his fane shall wait<SPLIT>, And keep the dreadful issues of his gate<SPLIT>, With bolts and iron bars<SPLIT>: within remains Imprison'd Fury<SPLIT>, bound in brazen chains<SPLIT>; High on a trophy rais'd<SPLIT>, of useless arms<SPLIT>, He sits<SPLIT>, and threats the world with vain alarms<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>, and sent Cyllenius with command To free the ports<SPLIT>, and ope the Punic land To Trojan guests<SPLIT>; lest<SPLIT>, ignorant of fate<SPLIT>, The queen might force them from her town and state<SPLIT>. Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies<SPLIT>, And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies<SPLIT>. Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god<SPLIT>, Performs his message<SPLIT>, and displays his rod<SPLIT>: The surly murmurs of the people cease<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, as the fates requir'd<SPLIT>, they give the peace<SPLIT>: The queen herself suspends the rigid laws<SPLIT>, The Trojans pities<SPLIT>, and protects their cause<SPLIT>.
Meantime<SPLIT>, in shades of night Aeneas lies<SPLIT>: Care seiz'd his soul<SPLIT>, and sleep forsook his eyes<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day<SPLIT>, He rose<SPLIT>, the coast and country to survey<SPLIT>, Anxious and eager to discover more<SPLIT>. It look'd a wild uncultivated shore<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, whether humankind<SPLIT>, or beasts alone Possess'd the new-found region<SPLIT>, was unknown<SPLIT>. Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides<SPLIT>: Tall trees surround the mountain<SPLIT>'s shady sides<SPLIT>; The bending brow above a safe retreat provides<SPLIT>. Arm'd with two pointed darts<SPLIT>, he leaves his friends<SPLIT>, And true Achates on his steps attends<SPLIT>. Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood<SPLIT>, Before his eyes his goddess mother stood<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>huntress in her habit and her mien<SPLIT>; Her dress a maid<SPLIT>, her air confess'd a queen<SPLIT>. Bare were her knees<SPLIT>, and knots her garments bind<SPLIT>; Loose was her hair<SPLIT>, and wanton'd in the wind<SPLIT>; Her hand sustain'd a bow<SPLIT>; her quiver hung behind<SPLIT>. She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood<SPLIT>: With such array Harpalyce bestrode Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Ho<SPLIT>, strangers<SPLIT>! have you lately seen<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>One of my sisters<SPLIT>, like myself array'd<SPLIT>, Who cross'd the lawn<SPLIT>, or in the forest stray'd<SPLIT>? A<SPLIT>painted quiver at her back she bore<SPLIT>; Varied with spots<SPLIT>, a lynx<SPLIT>'s hide she wore<SPLIT>; And at full cry pursued the tusky boar<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus Venus<SPLIT>: thus her son replied again<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>None of your sisters have we heard or seen<SPLIT>, O<SPLIT>virgin<SPLIT>! or what other name you bear Above that style<SPLIT>- O more than mortal fair<SPLIT>! Your voice and mien celestial birth betray<SPLIT>! If<SPLIT>, as you seem<SPLIT>, the sister of the day<SPLIT>, Or one at least of chaste Diana<SPLIT>'s train<SPLIT>, Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain<SPLIT>; But tell a stranger<SPLIT>, long in tempests toss'd<SPLIT>, What earth we tread<SPLIT>, and who commands the coast<SPLIT>? Then on your name shall wretched mortals call<SPLIT>, And offer'd victims at your altars fall<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" "<SPLIT>I dare not<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she replied<SPLIT>, "assume the name Of goddess<SPLIT>, or celestial honors claim<SPLIT>: For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear<SPLIT>, And purple buskins o<SPLIT>'er their ankles wear<SPLIT>. Know<SPLIT>, gentle youth<SPLIT>, in Libyan lands you are<SPLIT>- A<SPLIT>people rude in peace<SPLIT>, and rough in war<SPLIT>. The rising city<SPLIT>, which from far you see<SPLIT>, Is Carthage<SPLIT>, and a Tyrian colony<SPLIT>. Phoenician Dido rules the growing state<SPLIT>, Who fled from Tyre<SPLIT>, to shun her brother<SPLIT>'s hate<SPLIT>. Great were her wrongs<SPLIT>, her story full of fate<SPLIT>; Which I will sum in short<SPLIT>. Sichaeus<SPLIT>, known For wealth<SPLIT>, and brother to the Punic throne<SPLIT>, Possess'd fair Dido<SPLIT>'s bed<SPLIT>; and either heart At once was wounded with an equal dart<SPLIT>. Her father gave her<SPLIT>, yet a spotless maid<SPLIT>; Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd<SPLIT>: One who condemn'd divine and human laws<SPLIT>. Then strife ensued<SPLIT>, and cursed gold the cause<SPLIT>. The monarch<SPLIT>, blinded with desire of wealth<SPLIT>, With steel invades his brother<SPLIT>'s life by stealth<SPLIT>; Before the sacred altar made him bleed<SPLIT>, And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed<SPLIT>. Some tale<SPLIT>, some new pretense<SPLIT>, he daily coin'd<SPLIT>, To soothe his sister<SPLIT>, and delude her mind<SPLIT>. At length<SPLIT>, in dead of night<SPLIT>, the ghost appears Of her unhappy lord<SPLIT>: the specter stares<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, with erected eyes<SPLIT>, his bloody bosom bares<SPLIT>. The cruel altars and his fate he tells<SPLIT>, And the dire secret of his house reveals<SPLIT>, Then warns the widow<SPLIT>, with her household gods<SPLIT>, To seek a refuge in remote abodes<SPLIT>. Last<SPLIT>, to support her in so long a way<SPLIT>, He shows her where his hidden treasure lay<SPLIT>. Admonish'd thus<SPLIT>, and seiz'd with mortal fright<SPLIT>, The queen provides companions of her flight<SPLIT>: They meet<SPLIT>, and all combine to leave the state<SPLIT>, Who hate the tyrant<SPLIT>, or who fear his hate<SPLIT>. They seize a fleet<SPLIT>, which ready rigg'd they find<SPLIT>; Nor is Pygmalion<SPLIT>'s treasure left behind<SPLIT>. The vessels<SPLIT>, heavy laden<SPLIT>, put to sea With prosp'rous winds<SPLIT>; a woman leads the way<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>know not<SPLIT>, if by stress of weather driv'n<SPLIT>, Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n<SPLIT>; At last they landed<SPLIT>, where from far your eyes May view the turrets of new Carthage rise<SPLIT>; There bought a space of ground<SPLIT>, which (<SPLIT>Byrsa call'd<SPLIT>, From the bull<SPLIT>'s hide<SPLIT>) they first inclos'd<SPLIT>, and wall'd<SPLIT>. But whence are you<SPLIT>? what country claims your birth<SPLIT>? What seek you<SPLIT>, strangers<SPLIT>, on our Libyan earth<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>"
To whom<SPLIT>, with sorrow streaming from his eyes<SPLIT>, And deeply sighing<SPLIT>, thus her son replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Could you with patience hear<SPLIT>, or I relate<SPLIT>, O<SPLIT>nymph<SPLIT>, the tedious annals of our fate<SPLIT>! Thro<SPLIT>' such a train of woes if I should run<SPLIT>, The day would sooner than the tale be done<SPLIT>! From ancient Troy<SPLIT>, by force expell'd<SPLIT>, we came<SPLIT>- If you by chance have heard the Trojan name<SPLIT>. On various seas by various tempests toss'd<SPLIT>, At length we landed on your Libyan coast<SPLIT>. The good Aeneas am I call'd<SPLIT>- a name<SPLIT>, While Fortune favor'd<SPLIT>, not unknown to fame<SPLIT>. My household gods<SPLIT>, companions of my woes<SPLIT>, With pious care I rescued from our foes<SPLIT>. To fruitful Italy my course was bent<SPLIT>; And from the King of Heav'n is my descent<SPLIT>. With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea<SPLIT>; Fate and my mother goddess led my way<SPLIT>. Scarce sev'n<SPLIT>, the thin remainders of my fleet<SPLIT>, From storms preserv'd<SPLIT>, within your harbor meet<SPLIT>. Myself distress'd<SPLIT>, an exile<SPLIT>, and unknown<SPLIT>, Debarr'd from Europe<SPLIT>, and from Asia thrown<SPLIT>, In Libyan desarts wander thus alone<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
His tender parent could no longer bear<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, interposing<SPLIT>, sought to soothe his care<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Whoe<SPLIT>'er you are<SPLIT>- not unbelov'd by Heav'n<SPLIT>, Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n- Have courage<SPLIT>: to the gods permit the rest<SPLIT>, And to the queen expose your just request<SPLIT>. Now take this earnest of success<SPLIT>, for more<SPLIT>: Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore<SPLIT>; The winds are chang'd<SPLIT>, your friends from danger free<SPLIT>; Or I renounce my skill in augury<SPLIT>. Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move<SPLIT>, And stoop with closing pinions from above<SPLIT>; Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along<SPLIT>, And thro<SPLIT>' the clouds pursued the scatt<SPLIT>'ring throng<SPLIT>: Now<SPLIT>, all united in a goodly team<SPLIT>, They skim the ground<SPLIT>, and seek the quiet stream<SPLIT>. As they<SPLIT>, with joy returning<SPLIT>, clap their wings<SPLIT>, And ride the circuit of the skies in rings<SPLIT>; Not otherwise your ships<SPLIT>, and ev'ry friend<SPLIT>, Already hold the port<SPLIT>, or with swift sails descend<SPLIT>. No more advice is needful<SPLIT>; but pursue The path before you<SPLIT>, and the town in view<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus having said<SPLIT>, she turn'd<SPLIT>, and made appear Her neck refulgent<SPLIT>, and dishevel'd hair<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, flowing from her shoulders<SPLIT>, reach'd the ground<SPLIT>. And widely spread ambrosial scents around<SPLIT>: In length of train descends her sweeping gown<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, by her graceful walk<SPLIT>, the Queen of Love is known<SPLIT>. The prince pursued the parting deity With words like these<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Ah<SPLIT>! whither do you fly<SPLIT>? Unkind and cruel<SPLIT>! to deceive your son In borrow'd shapes<SPLIT>, and his embrace to shun<SPLIT>; Never to bless my sight<SPLIT>, but thus unknown<SPLIT>; And still to speak in accents not your own<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Against the goddess these complaints he made<SPLIT>, But took the path<SPLIT>, and her commands obey'd<SPLIT>. They march<SPLIT>, obscure<SPLIT>; for Venus kindly shrouds With mists their persons<SPLIT>, and involves in clouds<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, thus unseen<SPLIT>, their passage none might stay<SPLIT>, Or force to tell the causes of their way<SPLIT>. This part perform'd<SPLIT>, the goddess flies sublime To visit Paphos and her native clime<SPLIT>; Where garlands<SPLIT>, ever green and ever fair<SPLIT>, With vows are offer'd<SPLIT>, and with solemn pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>hundred altars in her temple smoke<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke<SPLIT>.
They climb the next ascent<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, looking down<SPLIT>, Now at a nearer distance view the town<SPLIT>. The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs<SPLIT>, Which late were huts and shepherds<SPLIT>' homely bow<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, The gates and streets<SPLIT>; and hears<SPLIT>, from ev'ry part<SPLIT>, The noise and busy concourse of the mart<SPLIT>. The toiling Tyrians on each other call To ply their labor<SPLIT>: some extend the wall<SPLIT>; Some build the citadel<SPLIT>; the brawny throng Or dig<SPLIT>, or push unwieldly stones along<SPLIT>. Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, first design'd<SPLIT>, with ditches they surround<SPLIT>. Some laws ordain<SPLIT>; and some attend the choice Of holy senates<SPLIT>, and elect by voice<SPLIT>. Here some design a mole<SPLIT>, while others there Lay deep foundations for a theater<SPLIT>; From marble quarries mighty columns hew<SPLIT>, For ornaments of scenes<SPLIT>, and future view<SPLIT>. Such is their toil<SPLIT>, and such their busy pains<SPLIT>, As exercise the bees in flow<SPLIT>'ry plains<SPLIT>, When winter past<SPLIT>, and summer scarce begun<SPLIT>, Invites them forth to labor in the sun<SPLIT>; Some lead their youth abroad<SPLIT>, while some condense Their liquid store<SPLIT>, and some in cells dispense<SPLIT>; Some at the gate stand ready to receive The golden burthen<SPLIT>, and their friends relieve<SPLIT>; All with united force<SPLIT>, combine to drive The lazy drones from the laborious hive<SPLIT>: With envy stung<SPLIT>, they view each other<SPLIT>'s deeds<SPLIT>; The fragrant work with diligence proceeds<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Thrice happy you<SPLIT>, whose walls already rise<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Aeneas said<SPLIT>, and view'd<SPLIT>, with lifted eyes<SPLIT>, Their lofty tow'rs<SPLIT>; then<SPLIT>, entiring at the gate<SPLIT>, Conceal'd in clouds (<SPLIT>prodigious to relate<SPLIT>) He mix'd<SPLIT>, unmark'd<SPLIT>, among the busy throng<SPLIT>, Borne by the tide<SPLIT>, and pass'd unseen along<SPLIT>.
Full in the center of the town there stood<SPLIT>, Thick set with trees<SPLIT>, a venerable wood<SPLIT>. The Tyrians<SPLIT>, landing near this holy ground<SPLIT>, And digging here<SPLIT>, a prosp'rous omen found<SPLIT>: From under earth a courser<SPLIT>'s head they drew<SPLIT>, Their growth and future fortune to foreshew<SPLIT>. This fated sign their foundress Juno gave<SPLIT>, Of a soil fruitful<SPLIT>, and a people brave<SPLIT>. Sidonian Dido here with solemn state Did Juno<SPLIT>'s temple build<SPLIT>, and consecrate<SPLIT>, Enrich'd with gifts<SPLIT>, and with a golden shrine<SPLIT>; But more the goddess made the place divine<SPLIT>. On brazen steps the marble threshold rose<SPLIT>, And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose<SPLIT>: The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd<SPLIT>; The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound<SPLIT>. What first Aeneas this place beheld<SPLIT>, Reviv'd his courage<SPLIT>, and his fear expell'd<SPLIT>. For while<SPLIT>, expecting there the queen<SPLIT>, he rais'd His wond<SPLIT>'ring eyes<SPLIT>, and round the temple gaz'd<SPLIT>, Admir'd the fortune of the rising town<SPLIT>, The striving artists<SPLIT>, and their arts<SPLIT>' renown<SPLIT>; He saw<SPLIT>, in order painted on the wall<SPLIT>, Whatever did unhappy Troy befall<SPLIT>: The wars that fame around the world had blown<SPLIT>, All to the life<SPLIT>, and ev'ry leader known<SPLIT>. There Agamemnon<SPLIT>, Priam here<SPLIT>, he spies<SPLIT>, And fierce Achilles<SPLIT>, who both kings defies<SPLIT>. He stopp'd<SPLIT>, and weeping said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O friend<SPLIT>! ev'n here The monuments of Trojan woes appear<SPLIT>! Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands<SPLIT>: See there<SPLIT>, where old unhappy Priam stands<SPLIT>! Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior<SPLIT>'s fame<SPLIT>, And Trojan griefs the Tyrians<SPLIT>' pity claim<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said (<SPLIT>his tears a ready passage find<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, Devouring what he saw so well design'd<SPLIT>, And with an empty picture fed his mind<SPLIT>: For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield<SPLIT>, And here the trembling Trojans quit the field<SPLIT>, Pursued by fierce Achilles thro<SPLIT>' the plain<SPLIT>, On his high chariot driving o<SPLIT>'er the slain<SPLIT>. The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew<SPLIT>, By their white sails betray'd to nightly view<SPLIT>; And wakeful Diomede<SPLIT>, whose cruel sword The sentries slew<SPLIT>, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord<SPLIT>, Then took the fiery steeds<SPLIT>, ere yet the food Of Troy they taste<SPLIT>, or drink the Xanthian flood<SPLIT>. Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied Achilles<SPLIT>, and unequal combat tried<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, where the boy disarm'd<SPLIT>, with loosen'd reins<SPLIT>, Was by his horses hurried o<SPLIT>'er the plains<SPLIT>, Hung by the neck and hair<SPLIT>, and dragg'd around<SPLIT>: The hostile spear<SPLIT>, yet sticking in his wound<SPLIT>, With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground<SPLIT>. Meantime the Trojan dames<SPLIT>, oppress'd with woe<SPLIT>, To Pallas<SPLIT>' fane in long procession go<SPLIT>, In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe<SPLIT>. They weep<SPLIT>, they beat their breasts<SPLIT>, they rend their hair<SPLIT>, And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear<SPLIT>; But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>. Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew The corpse of Hector<SPLIT>, whom in fight he slew<SPLIT>. Here Priam sues<SPLIT>; and there<SPLIT>, for sums of gold<SPLIT>, The lifeless body of his son is sold<SPLIT>. So sad an object<SPLIT>, and so well express'd<SPLIT>, Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero<SPLIT>'s breast<SPLIT>, To see the figure of his lifeless friend<SPLIT>, And his old sire his helpless hand extend<SPLIT>. Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train<SPLIT>, Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain<SPLIT>; And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew<SPLIT>, His pompous ensigns<SPLIT>, and his Indian crew<SPLIT>. Penthisilea there<SPLIT>, with haughty grace<SPLIT>, Leads to the wars an Amazonian race<SPLIT>: In their right hands a pointed dart they wield<SPLIT>; The left<SPLIT>, for ward<SPLIT>, sustains the lunar shield<SPLIT>. Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws<SPLIT>, Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes<SPLIT>, And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose<SPLIT>.
Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes<SPLIT>, Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise<SPLIT>, The beauteous Dido<SPLIT>, with a num<SPLIT>'rous train And pomp of guards<SPLIT>, ascends the sacred fane<SPLIT>. Such on Eurotas<SPLIT>' banks<SPLIT>, or Cynthus<SPLIT>' height<SPLIT>, Diana seems<SPLIT>; and so she charms the sight<SPLIT>, When in the dance the graceful goddess leads The choir of nymphs<SPLIT>, and overtops their heads<SPLIT>: Known by her quiver<SPLIT>, and her lofty mien<SPLIT>, She walks majestic<SPLIT>, and she looks their queen<SPLIT>; Latona sees her shine above the rest<SPLIT>, And feeds with secret joy her silent breast<SPLIT>. Such Dido was<SPLIT>; with such becoming state<SPLIT>, Amidst the crowd<SPLIT>, she walks serenely great<SPLIT>. Their labor to her future sway she speeds<SPLIT>, And passing with a gracious glance proceeds<SPLIT>; Then mounts the throne<SPLIT>, high plac'd before the shrine<SPLIT>: In crowds around<SPLIT>, the swarming people join<SPLIT>. She takes petitions<SPLIT>, and dispenses laws<SPLIT>, Hears and determines ev'ry private cause<SPLIT>; Their tasks in equal portions she divides<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, where unequal<SPLIT>, there by lots decides<SPLIT>. Another way by chance Aeneas bends His eyes<SPLIT>, and unexpected sees his friends<SPLIT>, Antheus<SPLIT>, Sergestus grave<SPLIT>, Cloanthus strong<SPLIT>, And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng<SPLIT>, Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd<SPLIT>, And widely scatter'd on another coast<SPLIT>. The prince<SPLIT>, unseen<SPLIT>, surpris'd with wonder stands<SPLIT>, And longs<SPLIT>, with joyful haste<SPLIT>, to join their hands<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, doubtful of the wish'd event<SPLIT>, he stays<SPLIT>, And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys<SPLIT>, Impatient till they told their present state<SPLIT>, And where they left their ships<SPLIT>, and what their fate<SPLIT>, And why they came<SPLIT>, and what was their request<SPLIT>; For these were sent<SPLIT>, commission'd by the rest<SPLIT>, To sue for leave to land their sickly men<SPLIT>, And gain admission to the gracious queen<SPLIT>. Ent<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>, with cries they fill'd the holy fane<SPLIT>; Then thus<SPLIT>, with lowly voice<SPLIT>, Ilioneus began<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>O queen<SPLIT>! indulg'd by favor of the gods To found an empire in these new abodes<SPLIT>, To build a town<SPLIT>, with statutes to restrain The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign<SPLIT>, We wretched Trojans<SPLIT>, toss'd on ev'ry shore<SPLIT>, From sea to sea<SPLIT>, thy clemency implore<SPLIT>. Forbid the fires our shipping to deface<SPLIT>! Receive th<SPLIT>' unhappy fugitives to grace<SPLIT>, And spare the remnant of a pious race<SPLIT>! We come not with design of wasteful prey<SPLIT>, To drive the country<SPLIT>, force the swains away<SPLIT>: Nor such our strength<SPLIT>, nor such is our desire<SPLIT>; The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>land there is<SPLIT>, Hesperia nam'd of old<SPLIT>; The soil is fruitful<SPLIT>, and the men are bold<SPLIT>- Th' Oenotrians held it once<SPLIT>- by common fame Now call'd Italia<SPLIT>, from the leader<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>. To that sweet region was our voyage bent<SPLIT>, When winds and ev'ry warring element Disturb'd our course<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, far from sight of land<SPLIT>, Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand<SPLIT>: The sea came on<SPLIT>; the South<SPLIT>, with mighty roar<SPLIT>, Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore<SPLIT>. Those few you see escap'd the Storm<SPLIT>, and fear<SPLIT>, Unless you interpose<SPLIT>, a shipwreck here<SPLIT>. What men<SPLIT>, what monsters<SPLIT>, what inhuman race<SPLIT>, What laws<SPLIT>, what barb'rous customs of the place<SPLIT>, Shut up a desart shore to drowning men<SPLIT>, And drive us to the cruel seas again<SPLIT>? If our hard fortune no compassion draws<SPLIT>, Nor hospitable rights<SPLIT>, nor human laws<SPLIT>, The gods are just<SPLIT>, and will revenge our cause<SPLIT>. Aeneas was our prince<SPLIT>: a juster lord<SPLIT>, Or nobler warrior<SPLIT>, never drew a sword<SPLIT>; Observant of the right<SPLIT>, religious of his word<SPLIT>. If yet he lives<SPLIT>, and draws this vital air<SPLIT>, Nor we<SPLIT>, his friends<SPLIT>, of safety shall despair<SPLIT>; Nor you<SPLIT>, great queen<SPLIT>, these offices repent<SPLIT>, Which he will equal<SPLIT>, and perhaps augment<SPLIT>. We want not cities<SPLIT>, nor Sicilian coasts<SPLIT>, Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts<SPLIT>. Permit our ships a shelter on your shores<SPLIT>, Refitted from your woods with planks and oars<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, if our prince be safe<SPLIT>, we may renew Our destin'd course<SPLIT>, and Italy pursue<SPLIT>. But if<SPLIT>, O best of men<SPLIT>, the Fates ordain That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main<SPLIT>, And if our young Iulus be no more<SPLIT>, Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore<SPLIT>, That we to good Acestes may return<SPLIT>, And with our friends our common losses mourn<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus spoke Ilioneus<SPLIT>: the Trojan crew With cries and clamors his request renew<SPLIT>.
The modest queen a while<SPLIT>, with downcast eyes<SPLIT>, Ponder'd the speech<SPLIT>; then briefly thus replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Trojans<SPLIT>, dismiss your fears<SPLIT>; my cruel fate<SPLIT>, And doubts attending an unsettled state<SPLIT>, Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes<SPLIT>. Who has not heard the story of your woes<SPLIT>, The name and fortune of your native place<SPLIT>, The fame and valor of the Phrygian race<SPLIT>? We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense<SPLIT>, Nor so remote from Phoebus<SPLIT>' influence<SPLIT>. Whether to Latian shores your course is bent<SPLIT>, Or<SPLIT>, driv'n by tempests from your first intent<SPLIT>, You seek the good Acestes<SPLIT>' government<SPLIT>, Your men shall be receiv'd<SPLIT>, your fleet repair'd<SPLIT>, And sail<SPLIT>, with ships of convoy for your guard<SPLIT>: Or<SPLIT>, would you stay<SPLIT>, and join your friendly pow'rs To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs<SPLIT>, My wealth<SPLIT>, my city<SPLIT>, and myself are yours<SPLIT>. And would to Heav'n<SPLIT>, the Storm<SPLIT>, you felt<SPLIT>, would bring On Carthaginian coasts your wand<SPLIT>'ring king<SPLIT>. My people shall<SPLIT>, by my command<SPLIT>, explore The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore<SPLIT>, And towns<SPLIT>, and wilds<SPLIT>, and shady woods<SPLIT>, in quest Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood<SPLIT>, And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud<SPLIT>: Achates found it<SPLIT>, and thus urg'd his way<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>From whence<SPLIT>, O goddess-born<SPLIT>, this long delay<SPLIT>? What more can you desire<SPLIT>, your welcome sure<SPLIT>, Your fleet in safety<SPLIT>, and your friends secure<SPLIT>? One only wants<SPLIT>; and him we saw in vain Oppose the Storm<SPLIT>, and swallow'd in the main<SPLIT>. Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid<SPLIT>; The rest agrees with what your mother said<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Scarce had he spoken<SPLIT>, when the cloud gave way<SPLIT>, The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day<SPLIT>.
The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight<SPLIT>, August in visage<SPLIT>, and serenely bright<SPLIT>. His mother goddess<SPLIT>, with her hands divine<SPLIT>, Had form'd his curling locks<SPLIT>, and made his temples shine<SPLIT>, And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace<SPLIT>, And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face<SPLIT>; Like polish'd ivory<SPLIT>, beauteous to behold<SPLIT>, Or Parian marble<SPLIT>, when enchas'd in gold<SPLIT>: Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke<SPLIT>, And thus with manly modesty he spoke<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>He whom you seek am I<SPLIT>; by tempests toss'd<SPLIT>, And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast<SPLIT>; Presenting<SPLIT>, gracious queen<SPLIT>, before your throne<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>prince that owes his life to you alone<SPLIT>. Fair majesty<SPLIT>, the refuge and redress Of those whom fate pursues<SPLIT>, and wants oppress<SPLIT>, You<SPLIT>, who your pious offices employ To save the relics of abando<SPLIT>n'd Troy<SPLIT>; Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore<SPLIT>, With hospitable rites relieve the poor<SPLIT>; Associate in your town a wand<SPLIT>'ring train<SPLIT>, And strangers in your palace entertain<SPLIT>: What thanks can wretched fugitives return<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, scatter'd thro<SPLIT>' the world<SPLIT>, in exile mourn<SPLIT>? The gods<SPLIT>, if gods to goodness are inclin'd<SPLIT>; If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, more than all the gods<SPLIT>, your gen'rous heart<SPLIT>. Conscious of worth<SPLIT>, requite its own desert<SPLIT>! In you this age is happy<SPLIT>, and this earth<SPLIT>, And parents more than mortal gave you birth<SPLIT>. While rolling rivers into seas shall run<SPLIT>, And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun<SPLIT>; While trees the mountain tops with shades supply<SPLIT>, Your honor<SPLIT>, name<SPLIT>, and praise shall never die<SPLIT>. Whate<SPLIT>'er abode my fortune has assign'd<SPLIT>, Your image shall be present in my mind<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus having said<SPLIT>, he turn'd with pious haste<SPLIT>, And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd<SPLIT>: With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd<SPLIT>, Serestus with his left<SPLIT>; then to his breast Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd<SPLIT>; And so by turns descended to the rest<SPLIT>.
The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face<SPLIT>, Pleas'd with his motions<SPLIT>, ravish'd with his grace<SPLIT>; Admir'd his fortunes<SPLIT>, more admir'd the man<SPLIT>; Then recollected stood<SPLIT>, and thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What fate<SPLIT>, O goddess-born<SPLIT>; what angry pow'rs Have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores<SPLIT>? Are you the great Aeneas<SPLIT>, known to fame<SPLIT>, Who from celestial seed your lineage claim<SPLIT>?
The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore To fam'd Anchises on th<SPLIT>' Idaean shore<SPLIT>? It calls into my mind<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' then a child<SPLIT>, When Teucer came<SPLIT>, from Salamis exil'd<SPLIT>, And sought my father<SPLIT>'s aid<SPLIT>, to be restor'd<SPLIT>: My father Belus then with fire and sword Invaded Cyprus<SPLIT>, made the region bare<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, conqu'ring<SPLIT>, finish'd the successful war<SPLIT>. From him the Trojan siege I understood<SPLIT>, The Grecian chiefs<SPLIT>, and your illustrious blood<SPLIT>. Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd<SPLIT>, And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd<SPLIT>. Enter<SPLIT>, my noble guest<SPLIT>, and you shall find<SPLIT>, If not a costly welcome<SPLIT>, yet a kind<SPLIT>: For I myself<SPLIT>, like you<SPLIT>, have been distress'd<SPLIT>, Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest<SPLIT>; Like you<SPLIT>, an alien in a land unknown<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>learn to pity woes so like my own<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" She said<SPLIT>, and to the palace led her guest<SPLIT>; Then offer'd incense<SPLIT>, and proclaim'd a feast<SPLIT>. Nor yet less careful for her absent friends<SPLIT>, Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends<SPLIT>; Besides a hundred boars<SPLIT>, a hundred lambs<SPLIT>, With bleating cries<SPLIT>, attend their milky dams<SPLIT>; And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls She gives<SPLIT>, to cheer the sailors<SPLIT>' drooping souls<SPLIT>. Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls<SPLIT>, And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls<SPLIT>: On Tyrian carpets<SPLIT>, richly wrought<SPLIT>, they dine<SPLIT>; With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine<SPLIT>, And antique vases<SPLIT>, all of gold emboss'd (<SPLIT>The gold itself inferior to the cost<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, Of curious work<SPLIT>, where on the sides were seen The fights and figures of illustrious men<SPLIT>, From their first founder to the present queen<SPLIT>.
The good Aeneas<SPLIT>, paternal care Iulus<SPLIT>' absence could no longer bear<SPLIT>, Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste<SPLIT>, To give a glad relation of the past<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, fraught with precious gifts<SPLIT>, to bring the boy<SPLIT>, Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>robe of tissue<SPLIT>, stiff with golden wire<SPLIT>; An upper vest<SPLIT>, once Helen<SPLIT>'s rich attire<SPLIT>, From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought<SPLIT>, With golden flow<SPLIT>'rs and winding foliage wrought<SPLIT>, Her mother Leda<SPLIT>'s present<SPLIT>, when she came To ruin Troy and set the world on flame<SPLIT>; The scepter Priam<SPLIT>'s eldest daughter bore<SPLIT>, Her orient necklace<SPLIT>, and the crown she wore Of double texture<SPLIT>, glorious to behold<SPLIT>, One order set with gems<SPLIT>, and one with gold<SPLIT>. Instructed thus<SPLIT>, the wise Achates goes<SPLIT>, And in his diligence his duty shows<SPLIT>.
But Venus<SPLIT>, anxious for her son<SPLIT>'s affairs<SPLIT>, New counsels tries<SPLIT>, and new designs prepares<SPLIT>: That Cupid should assume the shape and face Of sweet Ascanius<SPLIT>, and the sprightly grace<SPLIT>; Should bring the presents<SPLIT>, in her nephew<SPLIT>'s stead<SPLIT>, And in Eliza<SPLIT>'s veins the gentle poison shed<SPLIT>: For much she fear'd the Tyrians<SPLIT>, double-tongued<SPLIT>, And knew the town to Juno<SPLIT>'s care belong'd<SPLIT>. These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke<SPLIT>, And thus alarm'd<SPLIT>, to winged Love she spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>My son<SPLIT>, my strength<SPLIT>, whose mighty pow'r alone Controls the Thund<SPLIT>'rer on his awful throne<SPLIT>, To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies<SPLIT>, And on thy succor and thy faith relies<SPLIT>. Thou know<SPLIT>'st<SPLIT>, my son<SPLIT>, how Jove<SPLIT>'s revengeful wife<SPLIT>, By force and fraud<SPLIT>, attempts thy brother<SPLIT>'s life<SPLIT>; And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains<SPLIT>. Him Dido now with blandishment detains<SPLIT>; But I suspect the town where Juno reigns<SPLIT>. For this 't is needful to prevent her art<SPLIT>, And fire with love the proud Phoenician<SPLIT>'s heart<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>love so violent<SPLIT>, so strong<SPLIT>, so sure<SPLIT>, As neither age can change<SPLIT>, nor art can cure<SPLIT>. How this may be perform'd<SPLIT>, now take my mind<SPLIT>: Ascanius by his father is design'd To come<SPLIT>, with presents laden<SPLIT>, from the port<SPLIT>, To gratify the queen<SPLIT>, and gain the court<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, ravish'd<SPLIT>, in Idalian bow<SPLIT>'rs to keep<SPLIT>, Or high Cythera<SPLIT>, that the sweet deceit May pass unseen<SPLIT>, and none prevent the cheat<SPLIT>. Take thou his form and shape<SPLIT>. I beg the grace But only for a night<SPLIT>'s revolving space<SPLIT>: Thyself a boy<SPLIT>, assume a boy<SPLIT>'s dissembled face<SPLIT>; That when<SPLIT>, amidst the fervor of the feast<SPLIT>, The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast<SPLIT>, And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains<SPLIT>, Thou may<SPLIT>'st infuse thy venom in her veins<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The God of Love obeys<SPLIT>, and sets aside His bow and quiver<SPLIT>, and his plumy pride<SPLIT>; He walks Iulus in his mother<SPLIT>'s sight<SPLIT>, And in the sweet resemblance takes delight<SPLIT>.
The goddess then to young Ascanius flies<SPLIT>, And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes<SPLIT>: Lull'd in her lap<SPLIT>, amidst a train of Loves<SPLIT>, She gently bears him to her blissful groves<SPLIT>, Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head<SPLIT>, And softly lays him on a flow<SPLIT>'ry bed<SPLIT>. Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face<SPLIT>, Foll<SPLIT>'wing Achates with a shorter pace<SPLIT>, And brought the gifts<SPLIT>. The queen already sate Amidst the Trojan lords<SPLIT>, in shining state<SPLIT>, High on a golden bed<SPLIT>: her princely guest Was next her side<SPLIT>; in order sate the rest<SPLIT>. Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high<SPLIT>; Th' attendants water for their hands supply<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, having wash'd<SPLIT>, with silken towels dry<SPLIT>. Next fifty handmaids in long order bore The censers<SPLIT>, and with fumes the gods adore<SPLIT>: Then youths<SPLIT>, and virgins twice as many<SPLIT>, join To place the dishes<SPLIT>, and to serve the wine<SPLIT>. The Tyrian train<SPLIT>, admitted to the feast<SPLIT>, Approach<SPLIT>, and on the painted couches rest<SPLIT>. All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze<SPLIT>, But view the beauteous boy with more amaze<SPLIT>, His rosy-color'd cheeks<SPLIT>, his radiant eyes<SPLIT>, His motions<SPLIT>, voice<SPLIT>, and shape<SPLIT>, and all the god<SPLIT>'s disguise<SPLIT>; Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine<SPLIT>, Which wand<SPLIT>'ring foliage and rich flow<SPLIT>'rs entwine<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, far above the rest<SPLIT>, the royal dame<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Already doom'd to love<SPLIT>'s disastrous flame<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) With eyes insatiate<SPLIT>, and tumultuous joy<SPLIT>, Beholds the presents<SPLIT>, and admires the boy<SPLIT>. The guileful god about the hero long<SPLIT>, With children<SPLIT>'s play<SPLIT>, and false embraces<SPLIT>, hung<SPLIT>; Then sought the queen<SPLIT>: she took him to her arms With greedy pleasure<SPLIT>, and devour'd his charms<SPLIT>. Unhappy Dido little thought what guest<SPLIT>, How dire a god<SPLIT>, she drew so near her breast<SPLIT>; But he<SPLIT>, not mindless of his mother<SPLIT>'s pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>, Works in the pliant bosom of the fair<SPLIT>, And molds her heart anew<SPLIT>, and blots her former care<SPLIT>. The dead is to the living love resign'd<SPLIT>; And all Aeneas enters in her mind<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd<SPLIT>, The meat remov'd<SPLIT>, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd<SPLIT>, The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd<SPLIT>, And thro<SPLIT>' the palace cheerful cries resound<SPLIT>. From gilded roofs depending lamps display Nocturnal beams<SPLIT>, that emulate the day<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>golden bowl<SPLIT>, that shone with gems divine<SPLIT>, The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine<SPLIT>: The bowl that Belus us'd<SPLIT>, and all the Tyrian line<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, silence thro<SPLIT>' the hall proclaim'd<SPLIT>, she spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O hospitable Jove<SPLIT>! we thus invoke<SPLIT>, With solemn rites<SPLIT>, thy sacred name and pow'r<SPLIT>; Bless to both nations this auspicious hour<SPLIT>! So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line In lasting concord from this day combine<SPLIT>. Thou<SPLIT>, Bacchus<SPLIT>, god of joys and friendly cheer<SPLIT>, And gracious Juno<SPLIT>, both be present here<SPLIT>! And you<SPLIT>, my lords of Tyre<SPLIT>, your vows address To Heav'n with mine<SPLIT>, to ratify the peace<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The goblet then she took<SPLIT>, with nectar crown'd (<SPLIT>Sprinkling the first libations on the ground<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, sipping<SPLIT>, offer'd to the next in place<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T was Bitias whom she call'd<SPLIT>, a thirsty soul<SPLIT>; He took challenge<SPLIT>, and embrac'd the bowl<SPLIT>, With pleasure swill'd the gold<SPLIT>, nor ceas'd to draw<SPLIT>, Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw<SPLIT>.

BOOK II
All were attentive to the godlike man<SPLIT>, When from his lofty couch he thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Great queen<SPLIT>, what you command me to relate Renews the sad remembrance of our fate<SPLIT>: An empire from its old foundations rent<SPLIT>, And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>peopled city made a desart place<SPLIT>; All that I saw<SPLIT>, and part of which I was<SPLIT>: Not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear<SPLIT>, Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear<SPLIT>. And now the latter watch of wasting night<SPLIT>, And setting stars<SPLIT>, to kindly rest invite<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, since you take such int<SPLIT>'rest in our woe<SPLIT>, And Troy<SPLIT>'s disastrous end desire to know<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>will restrain my tears<SPLIT>, and briefly tell What in our last and fatal night befell<SPLIT>.

But storms of stones<SPLIT>, from the proud temple<SPLIT>'s height<SPLIT>, Pour down<SPLIT>, and on our batter'd helms alight<SPLIT>: We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow<SPLIT>, Who thought us Grecians<SPLIT>, as we seem'd in show<SPLIT>. They aim at the mistaken crests<SPLIT>, from high<SPLIT>; And ours beneath the pond<SPLIT>'rous ruin lie<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, mov'd with anger and disdain<SPLIT>, to see Their troops dispers'd<SPLIT>, the royal virgin free<SPLIT>, The Grecians rally<SPLIT>, and their pow'rs unite<SPLIT>, With fury charge us<SPLIT>, and renew the fight<SPLIT>. The brother kings with Ajax join their force<SPLIT>, And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Thus<SPLIT>, when the rival winds their quarrel try<SPLIT>, Contending for the kingdom of the sky<SPLIT>, South<SPLIT>, east<SPLIT>, and west<SPLIT>, on airy coursers borne<SPLIT>; The whirlwind gathers<SPLIT>, and the woods are torn<SPLIT>: Then Nereus strikes the deep<SPLIT>; the billows rise<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, mix'd with ooze and sand<SPLIT>, pollute the skies<SPLIT>. The troops we squander'd first again appear From several quarters<SPLIT>, and enclose the rear<SPLIT>. They first observe<SPLIT>, and to the rest betray<SPLIT>, Our diff'rent speech<SPLIT>; our borrow'd arms survey<SPLIT>. Oppress'd with odds<SPLIT>, we fall<SPLIT>; Coroebus first<SPLIT>, At Pallas<SPLIT>' altar<SPLIT>, by Peneleus pierc'd<SPLIT>. Then Ripheus follow'd<SPLIT>, in th<SPLIT>' unequal fight<SPLIT>; Just of his word<SPLIT>, observant of the right<SPLIT>: Heav'n thought not so<SPLIT>. Dymas their fate attends<SPLIT>, With Hypanis<SPLIT>, mistaken by their friends<SPLIT>.

Ye Trojan flames<SPLIT>, your testimony bear<SPLIT>, What I perform'd<SPLIT>, and what I suffer'd there<SPLIT>; No sword avoiding in the fatal strife<SPLIT>, Expos'd to death<SPLIT>, and prodigal of life<SPLIT>; Witness<SPLIT>, ye heavens<SPLIT>! I live not by my fault<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>strove to have deserv'd the death I sought<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, when I could not fight<SPLIT>, and would have died<SPLIT>, Borne off to distance by the growing tide<SPLIT>, Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence<SPLIT>, With Pelias wounded<SPLIT>, and without defense<SPLIT>. New clamors from th<SPLIT>' invested palace ring<SPLIT>: We run to die<SPLIT>, or disengage the king<SPLIT>. So hot th<SPLIT>' assault<SPLIT>, so high the tumult rose<SPLIT>, While ours defend<SPLIT>, and while the Greeks oppose As all the Dardan and Argolic race Had been contracted in that narrow space<SPLIT>; Or as all Ilium else were void of fear<SPLIT>, And tumult<SPLIT>, war<SPLIT>, and slaughter<SPLIT>, only there<SPLIT>. Their targets in a tortoise cast<SPLIT>, the foes<SPLIT>, Secure advancing<SPLIT>, to the turrets rose<SPLIT>: Some mount the scaling ladders<SPLIT>; some<SPLIT>, more bold<SPLIT>, Swerve upwards<SPLIT>, and by posts and pillars hold<SPLIT>; Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th<SPLIT>' ascent<SPLIT>, While with their right they seize the battlement<SPLIT>. From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw Huge heaps of stones<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, falling<SPLIT>, crush the foe<SPLIT>; And heavy beams and rafters from the sides (<SPLIT>Such arms their last necessity provides<SPLIT>) And gilded roofs<SPLIT>, come tumbling from on high<SPLIT>, The marks of state and ancient royalty<SPLIT>. The guards below<SPLIT>, fix'd in the pass<SPLIT>, attend The charge undaunted<SPLIT>, and the gate defend<SPLIT>. Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>second time we ran to tempt our death<SPLIT>, To clear the palace from the foe<SPLIT>, succeed The weary living<SPLIT>, and revenge the dead<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>A postern door<SPLIT>, yet unobserv'd and free<SPLIT>, Join'd by the length of a blind gallery<SPLIT>, To the king<SPLIT>'s closet led<SPLIT>: a way well known To Hector<SPLIT>'s wife<SPLIT>, while Priam held the throne<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' which she brought Astyanax<SPLIT>, unseen<SPLIT>, To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire<SPLIT>'s queen<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' this we pass<SPLIT>, and mount the tow'r<SPLIT>, from whence With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense<SPLIT>. From this the trembling king had oft descried The Grecian camp<SPLIT>, and saw their navy ride<SPLIT>. Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew<SPLIT>, Then<SPLIT>, wrenching with our hands<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' assault renew<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, where the rafters on the columns meet<SPLIT>, We push them headlong with our arms and feet<SPLIT>. The lightning flies not swifter than the fall<SPLIT>, Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall<SPLIT>: Down goes the top at once<SPLIT>; the Greeks beneath Are piecemeal torn<SPLIT>, or pounded into death<SPLIT>. Yet more succeed<SPLIT>, and more to death are sent<SPLIT>; We cease not from above<SPLIT>, nor they below relent<SPLIT>. Before the gate stood Pyrrhus<SPLIT>, threat<SPLIT>'ning loud<SPLIT>, With glitt<SPLIT>'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd<SPLIT>. So shines<SPLIT>, renew'd in youth<SPLIT>, the crested snake<SPLIT>, Who slept the winter in a thorny brake<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, casting off his slough when spring returns<SPLIT>, Now looks aloft<SPLIT>, and with new glory burns<SPLIT>; Restor'd with poisonous herbs<SPLIT>, his ardent sides Reflect the sun<SPLIT>; and rais'd on spires he rides<SPLIT>; High o<SPLIT>'er the grass<SPLIT>, hissing he rolls along<SPLIT>, And brandishes by fits his forky tongue<SPLIT>. Proud Periphas<SPLIT>, and fierce Automedon<SPLIT>, His father<SPLIT>'s charioteer<SPLIT>, together run To force the gate<SPLIT>; the Scyrian infantry Rush on in crowds<SPLIT>, and the barr'd passage free<SPLIT>. Ent<SPLIT>'ring the court<SPLIT>, with shouts the skies they rend<SPLIT>; And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend<SPLIT>. Himself<SPLIT>, among the foremost<SPLIT>, deals his blows<SPLIT>, And with his ax repeated strokes bestows On the strong doors<SPLIT>; then all their shoulders ply<SPLIT>, Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly<SPLIT>. He hews apace<SPLIT>; the double bars at length Yield to his ax and unresisted strength<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>mighty breach is made<SPLIT>: the rooms conceal'd Appear<SPLIT>, and all the palace is reveal'd<SPLIT>; The halls of audience<SPLIT>, and of public state<SPLIT>, And where the lonely queen in secret sate<SPLIT>. Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen<SPLIT>, With not a door<SPLIT>, and scarce a space<SPLIT>, between<SPLIT>. The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries<SPLIT>, And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies<SPLIT>; The fearful matrons run from place to place<SPLIT>, And kiss the thresholds<SPLIT>, and the posts embrace<SPLIT>. The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies<SPLIT>, And all his father sparkles in his eyes<SPLIT>; Nor bars<SPLIT>, nor fighting guards<SPLIT>, his force sustain<SPLIT>: The bars are broken<SPLIT>, and the guards are slain<SPLIT>. In rush the Greeks<SPLIT>, and all the apartments fill<SPLIT>; Those few defendants whom they find<SPLIT>, they kill<SPLIT>. Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood Roars<SPLIT>, when he finds his rapid course withstood<SPLIT>; Bears down the dams with unresisted sway<SPLIT>, And sweeps the cattle and the cots away<SPLIT>. These eyes beheld him when he march'd between The brother kings<SPLIT>: I saw th<SPLIT>' unhappy queen<SPLIT>, The hundred wives<SPLIT>, and where old Priam stood<SPLIT>, To stain his hallow'd altar with his brood<SPLIT>. The fifty nuptial beds (<SPLIT>such hopes had he<SPLIT>, So large a promise<SPLIT>, of a progeny<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, The posts<SPLIT>, of plated gold<SPLIT>, and hung with spoils<SPLIT>, Fell the reward of the proud victor<SPLIT>'s toils<SPLIT>.

"<SPLIT>Perhaps you may of Priam<SPLIT>'s fate enquire<SPLIT>. He<SPLIT>, when he saw his regal town on fire<SPLIT>, His ruin'd palace<SPLIT>, and his ent<SPLIT>'ring foes<SPLIT>, On ev'ry side inevitable woes<SPLIT>, In arms<SPLIT>, disus'd<SPLIT>, invests his limbs<SPLIT>, decay'd<SPLIT>, Like them<SPLIT>, with age<SPLIT>; a late and useless aid<SPLIT>. His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain<SPLIT>; Loaded<SPLIT>, not arm'd<SPLIT>, he creeps along with pain<SPLIT>, Despairing of success<SPLIT>, ambitious to be slain<SPLIT>! Uncover'd but by heav'n<SPLIT>, there stood in view An altar<SPLIT>; near the hearth a laurel grew<SPLIT>, Dodder'd with age<SPLIT>, whose boughs encompass round The household gods<SPLIT>, and shade the holy ground<SPLIT>. Here Hecuba<SPLIT>, with all her helpless train Of dames<SPLIT>, for shelter sought<SPLIT>, but sought in vain<SPLIT>. Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky<SPLIT>, Their images they hug<SPLIT>, and to their altars fly<SPLIT>. The Queen<SPLIT>, when she beheld her trembling lord<SPLIT>, And hanging by his side a heavy sword<SPLIT>, '<SPLIT>What rage<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>' she cried<SPLIT>, 'has seiz'd my husband<SPLIT>'s mind<SPLIT>?

The youth<SPLIT>, transfix'd<SPLIT>, with lamentable cries<SPLIT>, Expires before his wretched parent<SPLIT>'s eyes<SPLIT>: Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw<SPLIT>, The fear of death gave place to nature<SPLIT>'s law<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, shaking more with anger than with age<SPLIT>, '<SPLIT>The gods<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>' said he<SPLIT>, 'requite thy brutal rage<SPLIT>!

"<SPLIT>This said<SPLIT>, his feeble hand a javelin threw<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, flutt<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>, seem'd to loiter as it flew<SPLIT>: Just<SPLIT>, and but barely<SPLIT>, to the mark it held<SPLIT>, And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Then Pyrrhus thus<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Go thou from me to fate<SPLIT>, And to my father my foul deeds relate<SPLIT>.

Thus Priam fell<SPLIT>, and shar'd one common fate With Troy in ashes<SPLIT>, and his ruin'd state<SPLIT>: He<SPLIT>, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd<SPLIT>, Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd<SPLIT>. On the bleak shore now lies th<SPLIT>' abando<SPLIT>n'd king<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>headless carcass<SPLIT>, and a nameless thing<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Then<SPLIT>, not before<SPLIT>, I felt my cruddled blood Congeal with fear<SPLIT>, my hair with horror stood<SPLIT>: My father<SPLIT>'s image fill'd my pious mind<SPLIT>, Lest equal years might equal fortune find<SPLIT>. Again I thought on my forsaken wife<SPLIT>, And trembled for my son<SPLIT>'s abando<SPLIT>n'd life<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>look'd about<SPLIT>, but found myself alone<SPLIT>, Deserted at my need<SPLIT>! My friends were gone<SPLIT>. Some spent with toil<SPLIT>, some with despair oppress'd<SPLIT>, Leap'd headlong from the heights<SPLIT>; the flames consum'd the rest<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, wand<SPLIT>'ring in my way<SPLIT>, without a guide<SPLIT>, The graceless Helen in the porch I spied Of Vesta<SPLIT>'s temple<SPLIT>; there she lurk'd alone<SPLIT>; Muffled she sate<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, what she could<SPLIT>, unknown<SPLIT>: But<SPLIT>, by the flames that cast their blaze around<SPLIT>, That common bane of Greece and Troy I found<SPLIT>.

Long wand<SPLIT>'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree<SPLIT>; On land hard labors<SPLIT>, and a length of sea<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, after many painful years are past<SPLIT>, On Latium<SPLIT>'s happy shore you shall be cast<SPLIT>, Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds The flow<SPLIT>'ry meadows<SPLIT>, and the feeding folds<SPLIT>. There end your toils<SPLIT>; and there your fates provide A<SPLIT>quiet kingdom<SPLIT>, and a royal bride<SPLIT>: There fortune shall the Trojan line restore<SPLIT>, And you for lost Creusa weep no more<SPLIT>. Fear not that I shall watch<SPLIT>, with servile shame<SPLIT>, Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame<SPLIT>; Or<SPLIT>, stooping to the victor<SPLIT>'s lust<SPLIT>, disgrace My goddess mother<SPLIT>, or my royal race<SPLIT>. And now<SPLIT>, farewell<SPLIT>! The parent of the gods Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>trust our common issue to your care<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' She said<SPLIT>, and gliding pass'd unseen in air<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>strove to speak<SPLIT>: but horror tied my tongue<SPLIT>; And thrice about her neck my arms I flung<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, thrice deceiv'd<SPLIT>, on vain embraces hung<SPLIT>. Light as an empty dream at break of day<SPLIT>, Or as a blast of wind<SPLIT>, she rush'd away<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>to my longing friends return again<SPLIT>, Amaz'd th<SPLIT>' augmented number to behold<SPLIT>, Of men and matrons mix'd<SPLIT>, of young and old<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>wretched exil'd crew together brought<SPLIT>, With arms appointed<SPLIT>, and with treasure fraught<SPLIT>, Resolv'd<SPLIT>, and willing<SPLIT>, under my command<SPLIT>, To run all hazards both of sea and land<SPLIT>. The Morn began<SPLIT>, from Ida<SPLIT>, to display Her rosy cheeks<SPLIT>; and Phosphor led the day<SPLIT>: Before the gates the Grecians took their post<SPLIT>, And all pretense of late relief was lost<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>yield to Fate<SPLIT>, unwillingly retire<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, loaded<SPLIT>, up the hill convey my sire<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"

BOOK III
"<SPLIT>When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state And Priam<SPLIT>'s throne<SPLIT>, by too severe a fate<SPLIT>; When ruin'd Troy became the Grecians<SPLIT>' prey<SPLIT>, And Ilium<SPLIT>'s lofty tow'rs in ashes lay<SPLIT>; Warn'd by celestial omens<SPLIT>, we retreat<SPLIT>, To seek in foreign lands a happier seat<SPLIT>. Near old Antandros<SPLIT>, and at Ida<SPLIT>'s foot<SPLIT>, The timber of the sacred groves we cut<SPLIT>, And build our fleet<SPLIT>; uncertain yet to find What place the gods for our repose assign'd<SPLIT>. Friends daily flock<SPLIT>; and scarce the kindly spring Began to clothe the ground<SPLIT>, and birds to sing<SPLIT>, When old Anchises summon'd all to sea<SPLIT>: The crew my father and the Fates obey<SPLIT>. With sighs and tears I leave my native shore<SPLIT>, And empty fields<SPLIT>, where Ilium stood before<SPLIT>. My sire<SPLIT>, my son<SPLIT>, our less and greater gods<SPLIT>, All sail at once<SPLIT>, and cleave the briny floods<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Against our coast appears a spacious land<SPLIT>, Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Thracia the name<SPLIT>- the people bold in war<SPLIT>; Vast are their fields<SPLIT>, and tillage is their care<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) A<SPLIT>hospitable realm while Fate was kind<SPLIT>, With Troy in friendship and religion join'd<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>land<SPLIT>; with luckless omens then adore Their gods<SPLIT>, and draw a line along the shore<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>lay the deep foundations of a wall<SPLIT>, And Aenos<SPLIT>, nam'd from me<SPLIT>, the city call<SPLIT>. To Dionaean Venus vows are paid<SPLIT>, And all the pow'rs that rising labors aid<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>bull on Jove<SPLIT>'s imperial altar laid<SPLIT>. Not far<SPLIT>, a rising hillock stood in view<SPLIT>; Sharp myrtles on the sides<SPLIT>, and cornels grew<SPLIT>. There<SPLIT>, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes<SPLIT>, And shade our altar with their leafy greens<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>pull'd a plant<SPLIT>- with horror I relate A<SPLIT>prodigy so strange and full of fate<SPLIT>. The rooted fibers rose<SPLIT>, and from the wound Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground<SPLIT>. Mute and amaz'd<SPLIT>, my hair with terror stood<SPLIT>; Fear shrunk my sinews<SPLIT>, and congeal'd my blood<SPLIT>. Mann'd once again<SPLIT>, another plant I try<SPLIT>: That other gush'd with the same sanguine dye<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, fearing guilt for some offense unknown<SPLIT>, With pray<SPLIT>'rs and vows the Dryads I atone<SPLIT>, With all the sisters of the woods<SPLIT>, and most The God of Arms<SPLIT>, who rules the Thracian coast<SPLIT>, That they<SPLIT>, or he<SPLIT>, these omens would avert<SPLIT>, Release our fears<SPLIT>, and better signs impart<SPLIT>. Clear'd<SPLIT>, as I thought<SPLIT>, and fully fix'd at length To learn the cause<SPLIT>, I tugged with all my strength<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>bent my knees against the ground<SPLIT>; once more The violated myrtle ran with gore<SPLIT>. Scarce dare I tell the sequel<SPLIT>: from the womb Of wounded earth<SPLIT>, and caverns of the tomb<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>groan<SPLIT>, as of a troubled ghost<SPLIT>, renew'd My fright<SPLIT>, and then these dreadful words ensued<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Why dost thou thus my buried body rend<SPLIT>? O<SPLIT>spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend<SPLIT>! Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood<SPLIT>: The tears distil not from the wounded wood<SPLIT>; But ev'ry drop this living tree contains Is kindred blood<SPLIT>, and ran in Trojan veins<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>fly from this unhospitable shore<SPLIT>, Warn'd by my fate<SPLIT>; for I am Polydore<SPLIT>! Here loads of lances<SPLIT>, in my blood embrued<SPLIT>, Again shoot upward<SPLIT>, by my blood renew'd<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>'
"<SPLIT>My falt<SPLIT>'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare My horror<SPLIT>, and in bristles rose my hair<SPLIT>. When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent<SPLIT>, Old Priam<SPLIT>, fearful of the war<SPLIT>'s event<SPLIT>, This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent<SPLIT>: Loaded with gold<SPLIT>, he sent his darling<SPLIT>, far From noise and tumults<SPLIT>, and destructive war<SPLIT>, Committed to the faithless tyrant<SPLIT>'s care<SPLIT>; Who<SPLIT>, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline<SPLIT>, Forsook the weaker<SPLIT>, with the strong to join<SPLIT>; Broke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth<SPLIT>, And murder'd<SPLIT>, for his wealth<SPLIT>, the royal youth<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>sacred hunger of pernicious gold<SPLIT>! What bands of faith can impious lucre hold<SPLIT>? Now<SPLIT>, when my soul had shaken off her fears<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>call my father and the Trojan peers<SPLIT>; Relate the prodigies of Heav'n<SPLIT>, require What he commands<SPLIT>, and their advice desire<SPLIT>. All vote to leave that execrable shore<SPLIT>, Polluted with the blood of Polydore<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, ere we sail<SPLIT>, his fun'ral rites prepare<SPLIT>, Then<SPLIT>, to his ghost<SPLIT>, a tomb and altars rear<SPLIT>. In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round<SPLIT>, With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd<SPLIT>, With eyes dejected<SPLIT>, and with hair unbound<SPLIT>. Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour<SPLIT>, And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Now<SPLIT>, when the raging storms no longer reign<SPLIT>, But southern gales invite us to the main<SPLIT>, We launch our vessels<SPLIT>, with a prosp'rous wind<SPLIT>, And leave the cities and the shores behind<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>An island in th<SPLIT>' Aegaean main appears<SPLIT>; Neptune and wat<SPLIT>'ry Doris claim it theirs<SPLIT>. It floated once<SPLIT>, till Phoebus fix'd the sides To rooted earth<SPLIT>, and now it braves the tides<SPLIT>. Here<SPLIT>, borne by friendly winds<SPLIT>, we come ashore<SPLIT>, With needful ease our weary limbs restore<SPLIT>, And the Sun<SPLIT>'s temple and his town adore<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Anius<SPLIT>, the priest and king<SPLIT>, with laurel crown'd<SPLIT>, His hoary locks with purple fillets bound<SPLIT>, Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend<SPLIT>, Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend<SPLIT>; Invites him to his palace<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, in sign Of ancient love<SPLIT>, their plighted hands they join<SPLIT>. Then to the temple of the god I went<SPLIT>, And thus<SPLIT>, before the shrine<SPLIT>, my vows present<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Give<SPLIT>, O Thymbraeus<SPLIT>, give a resting place To the sad relics of the Trojan race<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>seat secure<SPLIT>, a region of their own<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>lasting empire<SPLIT>, and a happier town<SPLIT>. Where shall we fix<SPLIT>? where shall our labors end<SPLIT>? Whom shall we follow<SPLIT>, and what fate attend<SPLIT>? Let not my pray<SPLIT>'rs a doubtful answer find<SPLIT>; But in clear auguries unveil thy mind<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' Scarce had I said<SPLIT>: he shook the holy ground<SPLIT>, The laurels<SPLIT>, and the lofty hills around<SPLIT>; And from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound<SPLIT>. Prostrate we fell<SPLIT>; confess'd the present god<SPLIT>, Who gave this answer from his dark abode<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Undaunted youths<SPLIT>, go<SPLIT>, seek that mother earth From which your ancestors derive their birth<SPLIT>. The soil that sent you forth<SPLIT>, her ancient race In her old bosom shall again embrace<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' the wide world th<SPLIT>' Aeneian house shall reign<SPLIT>, And children<SPLIT>'s children shall the crown sustain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>mighty tumult<SPLIT>, mix'd with joy<SPLIT>, arose<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>All are concern'd to know what place the god Assign'd<SPLIT>, and where determin'd our abode<SPLIT>. My father<SPLIT>, long revolving in his mind The race and lineage of the Trojan kind<SPLIT>, Thus answer'd their demands<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Ye princes<SPLIT>, hear Your pleasing fortune<SPLIT>, and dispel your fear<SPLIT>. The fruitful isle of Crete<SPLIT>, well known to fame<SPLIT>, Sacred of old to Jove<SPLIT>'s imperial name<SPLIT>, In the mid ocean lies<SPLIT>, with large command<SPLIT>, And on its plains a hundred cities stand<SPLIT>. Another Ida rises there<SPLIT>, and we From thence derive our Trojan ancestry<SPLIT>. From thence<SPLIT>, as 't is divulg'd by certain fame<SPLIT>, To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came<SPLIT>; There fix'd<SPLIT>, and there the seat of empire chose<SPLIT>, Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs arose<SPLIT>. In humble vales they built their soft abodes<SPLIT>, Till Cybele<SPLIT>, the mother of the gods<SPLIT>, With tinkling cymbals charm'd th<SPLIT>' Idaean woods<SPLIT>, She secret rites and ceremonies taught<SPLIT>, And to the yoke the savage lions brought<SPLIT>. Let us the land which Heav'n appoints<SPLIT>, explore<SPLIT>; Appease the winds<SPLIT>, and seek the Gnossian shore<SPLIT>. If Jove assists the passage of our fleet<SPLIT>, The third propitious dawn discovers Crete<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' Thus having said<SPLIT>, the sacrifices<SPLIT>, laid On smoking altars<SPLIT>, to the gods he paid<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>bull<SPLIT>, to Neptune an oblation due<SPLIT>, Another bull to bright Apollo slew<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>milk-white ewe<SPLIT>, the western winds to please<SPLIT>, And one coal-black<SPLIT>, to calm the stormy seas<SPLIT>. Ere this<SPLIT>, a flying rumor had been spread That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled<SPLIT>, Expell'd and exil'd<SPLIT>; that the coast was free From foreign or domestic enemy<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>We leave the Delian ports<SPLIT>, and put to sea<SPLIT>; By Naxos<SPLIT>, fam'd for vintage<SPLIT>, make our way<SPLIT>; Then green Donysa pass<SPLIT>; and sail in sight Of Paros<SPLIT>' isle<SPLIT>, with marble quarries white<SPLIT>. We pass the scatter'd isles of Cyclades<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, scarce distinguish'd<SPLIT>, seem to stud the seas<SPLIT>. The shouts of sailors double near the shores<SPLIT>; They stretch their canvas<SPLIT>, and they ply their oars<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>All hands aloft<SPLIT>! for Crete<SPLIT>! for Crete<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>' they cry<SPLIT>, And swiftly thro<SPLIT>' the foamy billows fly<SPLIT>. Full on the promis'd land at length we bore<SPLIT>, With joy descending on the Cretan shore<SPLIT>. With eager haste a rising town I frame<SPLIT>, Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name<SPLIT>: The name itself was grateful<SPLIT>; I exhort To found their houses<SPLIT>, and erect a fort<SPLIT>. Our ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand<SPLIT>; The youth begin to till the labor'd land<SPLIT>; And I myself new marriages promote<SPLIT>, Give laws<SPLIT>, and dwellings I divide by lot<SPLIT>; When rising vapors choke the wholesome air<SPLIT>, And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year<SPLIT>; The trees devouring caterpillars burn<SPLIT>; Parch'd was the grass<SPLIT>, and blighted was the corn<SPLIT>: Nor 'scape the beasts<SPLIT>; for Sirius<SPLIT>, from on high<SPLIT>, With pestilential heat infects the sky<SPLIT>: My men<SPLIT>- some fall<SPLIT>, the rest in fevers fry<SPLIT>. Again my father bids me seek the shore Of sacred Delos<SPLIT>, and the god implore<SPLIT>, To learn what end of woes we might expect<SPLIT>, And to what clime our weary course direct<SPLIT>.
"'T was night<SPLIT>, when ev'ry creature<SPLIT>, void of cares<SPLIT>, The common gift of balmy slumber shares<SPLIT>: The statues of my gods (<SPLIT>for such they seem'd<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem'd<SPLIT>, Before me stood<SPLIT>, majestically bright<SPLIT>, Full in the beams of Phoebe<SPLIT>'s ent<SPLIT>'ring light<SPLIT>. Then thus they spoke<SPLIT>, and eas'd my troubled mind<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>What from the Delian god thou go<SPLIT>'st to find<SPLIT>, He tells thee here<SPLIT>, and sends us to relate<SPLIT>. Those pow'rs are we<SPLIT>, companions of thy fate<SPLIT>, Who from the burning town by thee were brought<SPLIT>, Thy fortune follow'd<SPLIT>, and thy safety wrought<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' seas and lands as we thy steps attend<SPLIT>, So shall our care thy glorious race befriend<SPLIT>. An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>town that o<SPLIT>'er the conquer'd world shall reign<SPLIT>. Thou<SPLIT>, mighty walls for mighty nations build<SPLIT>; Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield<SPLIT>: But change thy seat<SPLIT>; for not the Delian god<SPLIT>, Nor we<SPLIT>, have giv'n thee Crete for our abode<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>land there is<SPLIT>, Hesperia call'd of old<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>The soil is fruitful<SPLIT>, and the natives bold<SPLIT>- Th' Oenotrians held it once<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) by later fame Now call'd Italia<SPLIT>, from the leader<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>. lasius there and Dardanus were born<SPLIT>; From thence we came<SPLIT>, and thither must return<SPLIT>. Rise<SPLIT>, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet<SPLIT>. Search Italy<SPLIT>; for Jove denies thee Crete<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>'
"<SPLIT>Astonish'd at their voices and their sight<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Nor were they dreams<SPLIT>, but visions of the night<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>saw<SPLIT>, I knew their faces<SPLIT>, and descried<SPLIT>, In perfect view<SPLIT>, their hair with fillets tied<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>) I<SPLIT>started from my couch<SPLIT>; a clammy sweat On all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate<SPLIT>. To heav'n I lift my hands with pious haste<SPLIT>, And sacred incense in the flames I cast<SPLIT>. Thus to the gods their perfect honors done<SPLIT>, More cheerful<SPLIT>, to my good old sire I run<SPLIT>, And tell the pleasing news<SPLIT>. In little space He found his error of the double race<SPLIT>; Not<SPLIT>, as before he deem'd<SPLIT>, deriv'd from Crete<SPLIT>; No more deluded by the doubtful seat<SPLIT>: Then said<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>O son<SPLIT>, turmoil'd in Trojan fate<SPLIT>! Such things as these Cassandra did relate<SPLIT>. This day revives within my mind what she Foretold of Troy renew'd in Italy<SPLIT>, And Latian lands<SPLIT>; but who could then have thought That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought<SPLIT>, Or who believ'd what mad Cassandra taught<SPLIT>? Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>'
"<SPLIT>He said<SPLIT>; and we with glad consent obey<SPLIT>, Forsake the seat<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, leaving few behind<SPLIT>, We spread our sails before the willing wind<SPLIT>. Now from the sight of land our galleys move<SPLIT>, With only seas around and skies above<SPLIT>; When o<SPLIT>'er our heads descends a burst of rain<SPLIT>, And night with sable clouds involves the main<SPLIT>; The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise<SPLIT>; The scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways<SPLIT>; The face of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes<SPLIT>, And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies<SPLIT>. Cast from our course<SPLIT>, we wander in the dark<SPLIT>. No stars to guide<SPLIT>, no point of land to mark<SPLIT>. Ev'n Palinurus no distinction found Betwixt the night and day<SPLIT>; such darkness reign'd around<SPLIT>. Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays<SPLIT>, Without distinction<SPLIT>, and three sunless days<SPLIT>; The fourth renews the light<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, from our shrouds<SPLIT>, We view a rising land<SPLIT>, like distant clouds<SPLIT>; The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight<SPLIT>, And curling smoke ascending from their height<SPLIT>. The canvas falls<SPLIT>; their oars the sailors ply<SPLIT>; From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly<SPLIT>. At length I land upon the Strophades<SPLIT>, Safe from the danger of the stormy seas<SPLIT>. Those isles are compass'd by th<SPLIT>' Ionian main<SPLIT>, The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign<SPLIT>, Forc'd by the winged warriors to repair To their old homes<SPLIT>, and leave their costly fare<SPLIT>. Monsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne<SPLIT>'er sent From hell<SPLIT>'s abyss<SPLIT>, for human punishment<SPLIT>: With virgin faces<SPLIT>, but with wombs obscene<SPLIT>, Foul paunches<SPLIT>, and with ordure still unclean<SPLIT>; With claws for hands<SPLIT>, and looks for ever lean<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>We landed at the port<SPLIT>, and soon beheld Fat herds of oxen graze the flow<SPLIT>'ry field<SPLIT>, And wanton goats without a keeper stray'd<SPLIT>. With weapons we the welcome prey invade<SPLIT>, Then call the gods for partners of our feast<SPLIT>, And Jove himself<SPLIT>, the chief invited guest<SPLIT>. We spread the tables on the greensward ground<SPLIT>; We feed with hunger<SPLIT>, and the bowls go round<SPLIT>; When from the mountain-tops<SPLIT>, with hideous cry<SPLIT>, And clatt<SPLIT>'ring wings<SPLIT>, the hungry Harpies fly<SPLIT>; They snatch the meat<SPLIT>, defiling all they find<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, parting<SPLIT>, leave a loathsome stench behind<SPLIT>. Close by a hollow rock<SPLIT>, again we sit<SPLIT>, New dress the dinner<SPLIT>, and the beds refit<SPLIT>, Secure from sight<SPLIT>, beneath a pleasing shade<SPLIT>, Where tufted trees a native arbor made<SPLIT>. Again the holy fires on altars burn<SPLIT>; And once again the rav'nous birds return<SPLIT>, Or from the dark recesses where they lie<SPLIT>, Or from another quarter of the sky<SPLIT>; With filthy claws their odious meal repeat<SPLIT>, And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>bid my friends for vengeance then prepare<SPLIT>, And with the hellish nation wage the war<SPLIT>. They<SPLIT>, as commanded<SPLIT>, for the fight provide<SPLIT>, And in the grass their glitt<SPLIT>'ring weapons hide<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, when along the crooked shore we hear Their clatt<SPLIT>'ring wings<SPLIT>, and saw the foes appear<SPLIT>, Misenus sounds a charge<SPLIT>: we take th<SPLIT>' alarm<SPLIT>, And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm<SPLIT>. In this new kind of combat all employ Their utmost force<SPLIT>, the monsters to destroy<SPLIT>. In vain- the fated skin is proof to wounds<SPLIT>; And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds<SPLIT>. At length rebuff'd<SPLIT>, they leave their mangled prey<SPLIT>, And their stretch'd pinions to the skies display<SPLIT>. Yet one remain'd<SPLIT>- the messenger of Fate<SPLIT>: High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate<SPLIT>, And thus her dismal errand did relate<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>What<SPLIT>! not contented with our oxen slain<SPLIT>, Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain<SPLIT>, And drive the Harpies from their native reign<SPLIT>? Heed therefore what I say<SPLIT>; and keep in mind What Jove decrees<SPLIT>, what Phoebus has design'd<SPLIT>, And I<SPLIT>, the Furies<SPLIT>' queen<SPLIT>, from both relate- You seek th<SPLIT>' Italian shores<SPLIT>, foredoom'd by fate<SPLIT>: Th' Italian shores are granted you to find<SPLIT>, And a safe passage to the port assign'd<SPLIT>. But know<SPLIT>, that ere your promis'd walls you build<SPLIT>, My curses shall severely be fulfill'd<SPLIT>. Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed<SPLIT>, Reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' She said<SPLIT>, and to the neighb'ring forest flew<SPLIT>. Our courage fails us<SPLIT>, and our fears renew<SPLIT>. Hopeless to win by war<SPLIT>, to pray<SPLIT>'rs we fall<SPLIT>, And on th<SPLIT>' offended Harpies humbly call<SPLIT>, And whether gods or birds obscene they were<SPLIT>, Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer<SPLIT>. But old Anchises<SPLIT>, off'ring sacrifice<SPLIT>, And lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes<SPLIT>, Ador'd the greater gods<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Avert<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>' said he<SPLIT>, '<SPLIT>These omens<SPLIT>; render vain this prophecy<SPLIT>, And from th<SPLIT>' impending curse a pious people free<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>'
"<SPLIT>Thus having said<SPLIT>, he bids us put to sea<SPLIT>; We loose from shore our haulsers<SPLIT>, and obey<SPLIT>, And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat<SPLIT>'ry way<SPLIT>. Amidst our course<SPLIT>, Zacynthian woods appear<SPLIT>; And next by rocky Neritos we steer<SPLIT>: We fly from Ithaca<SPLIT>'s detested shore<SPLIT>, And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore<SPLIT>. At length Leucate<SPLIT>'s cloudy top appears<SPLIT>, And the Sun<SPLIT>'s temple<SPLIT>, which the sailor fears<SPLIT>. Resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past<SPLIT>, Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast<SPLIT>, And joyful to the little city haste<SPLIT>. Here<SPLIT>, safe beyond our hopes<SPLIT>, our vows we pay To Jove<SPLIT>, the guide and patron of our way<SPLIT>. The customs of our country we pursue<SPLIT>, And Trojan games on Actian shores renew<SPLIT>. Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil<SPLIT>, And exercise the wrastlers<SPLIT>' noble toil<SPLIT>; Pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind<SPLIT>, And left so many Grecian towns behind<SPLIT>. The sun had now fulfill'd his annual course<SPLIT>, And Boreas on the seas display'd his force<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>fix'd upon the temple<SPLIT>'s lofty door The brazen shield which vanquish'd Abas bore<SPLIT>; The verse beneath my name and action speaks<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' Then I command to weigh<SPLIT>; the seamen ply Their sweeping oars<SPLIT>; the smoking billows fly<SPLIT>. The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost<SPLIT>, And skimm'd along Epirus<SPLIT>' rocky coast<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Then to Chaonia<SPLIT>'s port our course we bend<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, landed<SPLIT>, to Buthrotus<SPLIT>' heights ascend<SPLIT>. Here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame<SPLIT>: How Helenus reviv'd the Trojan name<SPLIT>, And reign'd in Greece<SPLIT>; that Priam<SPLIT>'s captive son Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne<SPLIT>; And fair Andromache<SPLIT>, restor'd by fate<SPLIT>, Once more was happy in a Trojan mate<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>leave my galleys riding in the port<SPLIT>, And long to see the new Dardanian court<SPLIT>. By chance<SPLIT>, the mournful queen<SPLIT>, before the gate<SPLIT>, Then solemniz'd her former husband<SPLIT>'s fate<SPLIT>. Green altars<SPLIT>, rais'd of turf<SPLIT>, with gifts she crown'd<SPLIT>, And sacred priests in order stand around<SPLIT>, And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound<SPLIT>. The grove itself resembles Ida<SPLIT>'s wood<SPLIT>; And Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood<SPLIT>. But when at nearer distance she beheld My shining armor and my Trojan shield<SPLIT>, Astonish'd at the sight<SPLIT>, the vital heat Forsakes her limbs<SPLIT>; her veins no longer beat<SPLIT>: She faints<SPLIT>, she falls<SPLIT>, and scarce recov'ring strength<SPLIT>, Thus<SPLIT>, with a falt<SPLIT>'ring tongue<SPLIT>, she speaks at length<SPLIT>:
"'Are you alive<SPLIT>, O goddess-born<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>' she said<SPLIT>, '<SPLIT>Or if a ghost<SPLIT>, then where is Hector<SPLIT>'s shade<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>' At this<SPLIT>, she cast a loud and frightful cry<SPLIT>. With broken words I made this brief reply<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>All of me that remains appears in sight<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>live<SPLIT>, if living be to loathe the light<SPLIT>. No phantom<SPLIT>; but I drag a wretched life<SPLIT>, My fate resembling that of Hector<SPLIT>'s wife<SPLIT>. What have you suffer'd since you lost your lord<SPLIT>? By what strange blessing are you now restor'd<SPLIT>? Still are you Hector<SPLIT>'s<SPLIT>? or is Hector fled<SPLIT>, And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus<SPLIT>' bed<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>' With eyes dejected<SPLIT>, in a lowly tone<SPLIT>, After a modest pause she thus begun<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>'O only happy maid of Priam<SPLIT>'s race<SPLIT>, Whom death deliver'd from the foes<SPLIT>' embrace<SPLIT>! Commanded on Achilles<SPLIT>' tomb to die<SPLIT>, Not forc'd<SPLIT>, like us<SPLIT>, to hard captivity<SPLIT>, Or in a haughty master<SPLIT>'s arms to lie<SPLIT>. In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne<SPLIT>, Endur'd the victor<SPLIT>'s lust<SPLIT>, sustain'd the scorn<SPLIT>: Thus I submitted to the lawless pride Of Pyrrhus<SPLIT>, more a handmaid than a bride<SPLIT>. Cloy'd with possession<SPLIT>, he forsook my bed<SPLIT>, And Helen<SPLIT>'s lovely daughter sought to wed<SPLIT>; Then me to Trojan Helenus resign'd<SPLIT>, And his two slaves in equal marriage join'd<SPLIT>; Till young Orestes<SPLIT>, pierc'd with deep despair<SPLIT>, And longing to redeem the promis'd fair<SPLIT>, Before Apollo<SPLIT>'s altar slew the ravisher<SPLIT>. By Pyrrhus<SPLIT>' death the kingdom we regain'd<SPLIT>: At least one half with Helenus remain'd<SPLIT>. Our part<SPLIT>, from Chaon<SPLIT>, he Chaonia calls<SPLIT>, And names from Pergamus his rising walls<SPLIT>. But you<SPLIT>, what fates have landed on our coast<SPLIT>? What gods have sent you<SPLIT>, or what storms have toss'd<SPLIT>? Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy<SPLIT>, Sav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy<SPLIT>? O<SPLIT>tell me how his mother<SPLIT>'s loss he bears<SPLIT>, What hopes are promis'd from his blooming years<SPLIT>, How much of Hector in his face appears<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>' She spoke<SPLIT>; and mix'd her speech with mournful cries<SPLIT>, And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>At length her lord descends upon the plain<SPLIT>, In pomp<SPLIT>, attended with a num<SPLIT>'rous train<SPLIT>; Receives his friends<SPLIT>, and to the city leads<SPLIT>, And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds<SPLIT>. Proceeding on<SPLIT>, another Troy I see<SPLIT>, Or<SPLIT>, in less compass<SPLIT>, Troy<SPLIT>'s epitome<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran<SPLIT>, And I embrace the Scaean gate again<SPLIT>. My friends in porticoes were entertain'd<SPLIT>, And feasts and pleasures thro<SPLIT>' the city reign'd<SPLIT>. The tables fill'd the spacious hall around<SPLIT>, And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd<SPLIT>. Two days we pass'd in mirth<SPLIT>, till friendly gales<SPLIT>, Blown from the south supplied our swelling sails<SPLIT>. Then to the royal seer I thus began<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>O thou<SPLIT>, who know<SPLIT>'st<SPLIT>, beyond the reach of man<SPLIT>, The laws of heav'n<SPLIT>, and what the stars decree<SPLIT>; Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy<SPLIT>, From his own tripod<SPLIT>, and his holy tree<SPLIT>; Skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air<SPLIT>, What auspices their notes and flights declare<SPLIT>: O<SPLIT>say- for all religious rites portend A<SPLIT>happy voyage<SPLIT>, and a prosp'rous end<SPLIT>; And ev'ry power and omen of the sky Direct my course for destin'd Italy<SPLIT>; But only dire Celaeno<SPLIT>, from the gods<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>dismal famine fatally forebodes<SPLIT>- O<SPLIT>say what dangers I am first to shun<SPLIT>, What toils vanquish<SPLIT>, and what course to run<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>'
"<SPLIT>The prophet first with sacrifice adores The greater gods<SPLIT>; their pardon then implores<SPLIT>; Unbinds the fillet from his holy head<SPLIT>; To Phoebus<SPLIT>, next<SPLIT>, my trembling steps he led<SPLIT>, Full of religious doubts and awful dread<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, with his god possess'd<SPLIT>, before the shrine<SPLIT>, These words proceeded from his mouth divine<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>O goddess-born<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>for Heav'n<SPLIT>'s appointed will<SPLIT>, With greater auspices of good than ill<SPLIT>, Foreshows thy voyage<SPLIT>, and thy course directs<SPLIT>; Thy fates conspire<SPLIT>, and Jove himself protects<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Of many things some few I shall explain<SPLIT>, Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main<SPLIT>, And how at length the promis'd shore to gain<SPLIT>. The rest the fates from Helenus conceal<SPLIT>, And Juno<SPLIT>'s angry pow'r forbids to tell<SPLIT>. First<SPLIT>, then<SPLIT>, that happy shore<SPLIT>, that seems so nigh<SPLIT>, Will far from your deluded wishes fly<SPLIT>; Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy<SPLIT>: For you must cruise along Sicilian shores<SPLIT>, And stem the currents with your struggling oars<SPLIT>; Then round th<SPLIT>' Italian coast your navy steer<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, after this<SPLIT>, to Circe<SPLIT>'s island veer<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, last<SPLIT>, before your new foundations rise<SPLIT>, Must pass the Stygian lake<SPLIT>, and view the nether skies<SPLIT>. Now mark the signs of future ease and rest<SPLIT>, And bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast<SPLIT>. When<SPLIT>, in the shady shelter of a wood<SPLIT>, And near the margin of a gentle flood<SPLIT>, Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground<SPLIT>, With thirty sucking young encompass'd round<SPLIT>; The dam and offspring white as falling snow- These on thy city shall their name bestow<SPLIT>, And there shall end thy labors and thy woe<SPLIT>. Nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind<SPLIT>, For Phoebus will assist<SPLIT>, and Fate the way will find<SPLIT>. Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent<SPLIT>, Which fronts from far th<SPLIT>' Epirian continent<SPLIT>: Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd<SPLIT>; The salvage Locrians here the shores infest<SPLIT>; There fierce Idomeneus his city builds<SPLIT>, And guards with arms the Salentinian fields<SPLIT>; And on the mountain<SPLIT>'s brow Petilia stands<SPLIT>, Which Philoctetes with his troops commands<SPLIT>. Ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore<SPLIT>, And priests with holy vows the gods adore<SPLIT>, Then with a purple veil involve your eyes<SPLIT>, Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice<SPLIT>. These rites and customs to the rest commend<SPLIT>, That to your pious race they may descend<SPLIT>.
" '<SPLIT>When<SPLIT>, parted hence<SPLIT>, the wind<SPLIT>, that ready waits For Sicily<SPLIT>, shall bear you to the straits Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way<SPLIT>, Tack to the larboard<SPLIT>, and stand off to sea<SPLIT>: Veer starboard sea and land<SPLIT>. Th' Italian shore And fair Sicilia<SPLIT>'s coast were one<SPLIT>, before An earthquake caus'd the flaw<SPLIT>: the roaring tides The passage broke that land from land divides<SPLIT>; And where the lands retir'd<SPLIT>, the rushing ocean rides<SPLIT>. Distinguish'd by the straits<SPLIT>, on either hand<SPLIT>, Now rising cities in long order stand<SPLIT>, And fruitful fields<SPLIT>: so much can time invade The mold<SPLIT>'ring work that beauteous Nature made<SPLIT>. Far on the right<SPLIT>, her dogs foul Scylla hides<SPLIT>: Charybdis roaring on the left presides<SPLIT>, And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides<SPLIT>; Then spouts them from below<SPLIT>: with fury driv'n<SPLIT>, The waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n<SPLIT>. But Scylla from her den<SPLIT>, with open jaws<SPLIT>, The sinking vessel in her eddy draws<SPLIT>, Then dashes on the rocks<SPLIT>. A human face<SPLIT>, And virgin bosom<SPLIT>, hides her tail<SPLIT>'s disgrace<SPLIT>: Her parts obscene below the waves descend<SPLIT>, With dogs inclos'd<SPLIT>, and in a dolphin end<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is safer<SPLIT>, then<SPLIT>, to bear aloof to sea<SPLIT>, And coast Pachynus<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' with more delay<SPLIT>, Than once to view misshapen Scylla near<SPLIT>, And the loud yell of wat<SPLIT>'ry wolves to hear<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>'Besides<SPLIT>, if faith to Helenus be due<SPLIT>, And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true<SPLIT>, Do not this precept of your friend forget<SPLIT>, Which therefore more than once I must repeat<SPLIT>: Above the rest<SPLIT>, great Juno<SPLIT>'s name adore<SPLIT>; Pay vows to Juno<SPLIT>; Juno<SPLIT>'s aid implore<SPLIT>. Let gifts be to the mighty queen design'd<SPLIT>, And mollify with pray<SPLIT>'rs her haughty mind<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, at the length<SPLIT>, your passage shall be free<SPLIT>, And you shall safe descend on Italy<SPLIT>. Arriv'd at Cumae<SPLIT>, when you view the flood Of black Avernus<SPLIT>, and the sounding wood<SPLIT>, The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find<SPLIT>, Dark in a cave<SPLIT>, and on a rock reclin'd<SPLIT>. She sings the fates<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, in her frantic fits<SPLIT>, The notes and names<SPLIT>, inscrib'd<SPLIT>, to leafs commits<SPLIT>. What she commits to leafs<SPLIT>, in order laid<SPLIT>, Before the cavern<SPLIT>'s entrance are display'd<SPLIT>: Unmov'd they lie<SPLIT>; but<SPLIT>, if a blast of wind Without<SPLIT>, or vapors issue from behind<SPLIT>, The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air<SPLIT>, And she resumes no more her museful care<SPLIT>, Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse<SPLIT>, Nor sets in order what the winds disperse<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, many not succeeding<SPLIT>, most upbraid The madness of the visionary maid<SPLIT>, And with loud curses leave the mystic shade<SPLIT>.
"'Think it not loss of time a while to stay<SPLIT>, Tho<SPLIT>' thy companions chide thy long delay<SPLIT>; Tho<SPLIT>' summon'd to the seas<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' pleasing gales Invite thy course<SPLIT>, and stretch thy swelling sails<SPLIT>: But beg the sacred priestess to relate With willing words<SPLIT>, and not to write thy fate<SPLIT>. The fierce Italian people she will show<SPLIT>, And all thy wars<SPLIT>, and all thy future woe<SPLIT>, And what thou may<SPLIT>'st avoid<SPLIT>, and what must undergo<SPLIT>. She shall direct thy course<SPLIT>, instruct thy mind<SPLIT>, And teach thee how the happy shores to find<SPLIT>. This is what Heav'n allows me to relate<SPLIT>: Now part in peace<SPLIT>; pursue thy better fate<SPLIT>, And raise<SPLIT>, by strength of arms<SPLIT>, the Trojan state<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>'
"<SPLIT>This when the priest with friendly voice declar'd<SPLIT>, He gave me license<SPLIT>, and rich gifts prepar'd<SPLIT>: Bounteous of treasure<SPLIT>, he supplied my want With heavy gold<SPLIT>, and polish'd elephant<SPLIT>; Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board<SPLIT>, And ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>trusty coat of mail to me he sent<SPLIT>, Thrice chain'd with gold<SPLIT>, for use and ornament<SPLIT>; The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest<SPLIT>, That flourish'd with a plume and waving crest<SPLIT>.

"<SPLIT>Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd<SPLIT>, Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord<SPLIT>.

"<SPLIT>With tears I took my last adieu<SPLIT>, and said<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Your fortune<SPLIT>, happy pair<SPLIT>, already made<SPLIT>, Leaves you no farther wish<SPLIT>.

Our fortunes<SPLIT>, good or bad<SPLIT>, shall be the same<SPLIT>: The double Troy shall differ but in name<SPLIT>; That what we now begin may never end<SPLIT>, But long to late posterity descend<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>'
"<SPLIT>Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore<SPLIT>; The shortest passage to th<SPLIT>' Italian shore<SPLIT>.

Close by the shore we lay<SPLIT>; the sailors keep Their watches<SPLIT>, and the rest securely sleep. The night<SPLIT>, proceeding on with silent pace<SPLIT>, Stood in her noon<SPLIT>, and view'd with equal face Her steepy rise and her declining race<SPLIT>. Then wakeful Palinurus rose<SPLIT>, to spy The face of heav'n<SPLIT>, and the nocturnal sky<SPLIT>; And listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try<SPLIT>; Observes the stars<SPLIT>, and notes their sliding course<SPLIT>, The Pleiads<SPLIT>, Hyads<SPLIT>, and their wat<SPLIT>'ry force<SPLIT>; And both the Bears is careful to behold<SPLIT>, And bright Orion<SPLIT>, arm'd with burnish'd gold<SPLIT>.

Minerva<SPLIT>'s temple then salutes our sight<SPLIT>, Plac'd<SPLIT>, as a landmark<SPLIT>, on the mountain<SPLIT>'s height<SPLIT>.

"<SPLIT>Scarce had he said<SPLIT>, when on the mountain<SPLIT>'s brow We saw the giant shepherd stalk before His following flock<SPLIT>, and leading to the shore<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>monstrous bulk<SPLIT>, deform'd<SPLIT>, depriv'd of sight<SPLIT>; His staff a trunk of pine<SPLIT>, to guide his steps aright<SPLIT>.

BOOK IV
But anxious cares already seiz'd the queen<SPLIT>: She fed within her veins a flame unseen<SPLIT>; The hero<SPLIT>'s valor<SPLIT>, acts<SPLIT>, and birth inspire Her soul with love<SPLIT>, and fan the secret fire<SPLIT>. His words<SPLIT>, his looks<SPLIT>, imprinted in her heart<SPLIT>, Improve the passion<SPLIT>, and increase the smart<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, when the purple morn had chas'd away The dewy shadows<SPLIT>, and restor'd the day<SPLIT>, Her sister first with early care she sought<SPLIT>, And thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>My dearest Anna<SPLIT>, what new dreams affright My lab'ring soul<SPLIT>! what visions of the night Disturb my quiet<SPLIT>, and distract my breast With strange ideas of our Trojan guest<SPLIT>! His worth<SPLIT>, his actions<SPLIT>, and majestic air<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>man descended from the gods declare<SPLIT>. Fear ever argues a degenerate kind<SPLIT>; His birth is well asserted by his mind<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, what he suffer'd<SPLIT>, when by Fate betray'd<SPLIT>! What brave attempts for falling Troy he made<SPLIT>! Such were his looks<SPLIT>, so gracefully he spoke<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, were I not resolv'd against the yoke Of hapless marriage<SPLIT>, never to be curst With second love<SPLIT>, so fatal was my first<SPLIT>, To this one error I might yield again<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, since Sichaeus was untimely slain<SPLIT>, This only man is able to subvert The fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart<SPLIT>. And<SPLIT>, to confess my frailty<SPLIT>, to my shame<SPLIT>, Somewhat I find within<SPLIT>, if not the same<SPLIT>, Too like the sparkles of my former flame<SPLIT>. But first let yawning earth a passage rend<SPLIT>, And let me thro<SPLIT>' the dark abyss descend<SPLIT>; First let avenging Jove<SPLIT>, with flames from high<SPLIT>, Drive down this body to the nether sky<SPLIT>, Condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie<SPLIT>, Before I break the plighted faith I gave<SPLIT>! No! he who had my vows shall ever have<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, whom I lov'd on earth<SPLIT>, I worship in the grave<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
She said<SPLIT>: the tears ran gushing from her eyes<SPLIT>, And stopp'd her speech<SPLIT>. Her sister thus replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O dearer than the vital air I breathe<SPLIT>, Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath<SPLIT>, Condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life<SPLIT>, Without the joys of mother or of wife<SPLIT>? Think you these tears<SPLIT>, this pompous train of woe<SPLIT>, Are known or valued by the ghosts below<SPLIT>? I<SPLIT>grant that<SPLIT>, while your sorrows yet were green<SPLIT>, It well became a woman<SPLIT>, and a queen<SPLIT>, The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect<SPLIT>, To scorn Hyarbas<SPLIT>, and his love reject<SPLIT>, With all the Libyan lords of mighty name<SPLIT>; But will you fight against a pleasing flame<SPLIT>! This little spot of land<SPLIT>, which Heav'n bestows<SPLIT>, On ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes<SPLIT>; Gaetulian cities here are spread around<SPLIT>, And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound<SPLIT>; Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land<SPLIT>, And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand<SPLIT>; Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore<SPLIT>, And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more<SPLIT>. Propitious Heav'n<SPLIT>, and gracious Juno<SPLIT>, lead This wand<SPLIT>'ring navy to your needful aid<SPLIT>: How will your empire spread<SPLIT>, your city rise<SPLIT>, From such a union<SPLIT>, and with such allies<SPLIT>? Implore the favor of the pow'rs above<SPLIT>, And leave the conduct of the rest to love<SPLIT>. Continue still your hospitable way<SPLIT>, And still invent occasions of their stay<SPLIT>, Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat<SPLIT>, And planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
These words<SPLIT>, which from a friend and sister came<SPLIT>, With ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame<SPLIT>, And added fury to the kindled flame<SPLIT>. Inspir'd with hope<SPLIT>, the project they pursue<SPLIT>; On ev'ry altar sacrifice renew<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>chosen ewe of two years old they pay To Ceres<SPLIT>, Bacchus<SPLIT>, and the God of Day<SPLIT>; Preferring Juno<SPLIT>'s pow'r<SPLIT>, for Juno ties The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys<SPLIT>. The beauteous queen before her altar stands<SPLIT>, And holds the golden goblet in her hands<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>milk-white heifer she with flow<SPLIT>'rs adorns<SPLIT>, And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, while the priests with pray<SPLIT>'r the gods invoke<SPLIT>, She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke<SPLIT>, With hourly care the sacrifice renews<SPLIT>, And anxiously the panting entrails views<SPLIT>. What priestly rites<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! what pious art<SPLIT>, What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart<SPLIT>! A<SPLIT>gentle fire she feeds within her veins<SPLIT>, Where the soft god secure in silence reigns<SPLIT>.
Sick with desire<SPLIT>, and seeking him she loves<SPLIT>, From street to street the raving Dido roves<SPLIT>. So when the watchful shepherd<SPLIT>, from the blind<SPLIT>, Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind<SPLIT>, Distracted with her pain she flies the woods<SPLIT>, Bounds o<SPLIT>'er the lawn<SPLIT>, and seeks the silent floods<SPLIT>, With fruitless care<SPLIT>; for still the fatal dart Sticks in her side<SPLIT>, and rankles in her heart<SPLIT>. And now she leads the Trojan chief along The lofty walls<SPLIT>, amidst the busy throng<SPLIT>; Displays her Tyrian wealth<SPLIT>, and rising town<SPLIT>, Which love<SPLIT>, without his labor<SPLIT>, makes his own<SPLIT>. This pomp she shows<SPLIT>, to tempt her wand<SPLIT>'ring guest<SPLIT>; Her falt<SPLIT>'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest<SPLIT>. When day declines<SPLIT>, and feasts renew the night<SPLIT>, Still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight<SPLIT>; She longs again to hear the prince relate His own adventures and the Trojan fate<SPLIT>. He tells it o<SPLIT>'er and o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>; but still in vain<SPLIT>, For still she begs to hear it once again<SPLIT>. The hearer on the speaker<SPLIT>'s mouth depends<SPLIT>, And thus the tragic story never ends<SPLIT>.
Then<SPLIT>, when they part<SPLIT>, when Phoebe<SPLIT>'s paler light Withdraws<SPLIT>, and falling stars to sleep invite<SPLIT>, She last remains<SPLIT>, when ev'ry guest is gone<SPLIT>, Sits on the bed he press'd<SPLIT>, and sighs alone<SPLIT>; Absent<SPLIT>, her absent hero sees and hears<SPLIT>; Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears<SPLIT>, And seeks the father<SPLIT>'s image in the child<SPLIT>, If love by likeness might be so beguil'd<SPLIT>.
Meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand<SPLIT>; No labors exercise the youthful band<SPLIT>, Nor use of arts<SPLIT>, nor toils of arms they know<SPLIT>; The mole is left unfinish'd to the foe<SPLIT>; The mounds<SPLIT>, the works<SPLIT>, the walls<SPLIT>, neglected lie<SPLIT>, Short of their promis'd heighth<SPLIT>, that seem'd to threat the sky<SPLIT>,
But when imperial Juno<SPLIT>, from above<SPLIT>, Saw Dido fetter'd in the chains of love<SPLIT>, Hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd<SPLIT>, And by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd<SPLIT>, With soothing words to Venus she begun<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>High praises<SPLIT>, endless honors<SPLIT>, you have won<SPLIT>, And mighty trophies<SPLIT>, with your worthy son<SPLIT>! Two gods a silly woman have undone<SPLIT>! Nor am I ignorant<SPLIT>, you both suspect This rising city<SPLIT>, which my hands erect<SPLIT>: But shall celestial discord never cease<SPLIT>? '<SPLIT>T is better ended in a lasting peace<SPLIT>. You stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd<SPLIT>: Poor Dido with consuming love is fir'd<SPLIT>. Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join<SPLIT>; So Dido shall be yours<SPLIT>, Aeneas mine<SPLIT>: One common kingdom<SPLIT>, one united line<SPLIT>. Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey<SPLIT>, And lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then Venus<SPLIT>, who her hidden fraud descried<SPLIT>, Which would the scepter of the world misguide To Libyan shores<SPLIT>, thus artfully replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Who<SPLIT>, but a fool<SPLIT>, would wars with Juno choose<SPLIT>, And such alliance and such gifts refuse<SPLIT>, If Fortune with our joint desires comply<SPLIT>? The doubt is all from Jove and destiny<SPLIT>; Lest he forbid<SPLIT>, with absolute command<SPLIT>, To mix the people in one common land<SPLIT>- Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line In lasting leagues and sure succession join<SPLIT>? But you<SPLIT>, the partner of his bed and throne<SPLIT>, May move his mind<SPLIT>; my wishes are your own<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
"<SPLIT>Mine<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said imperial Juno<SPLIT>, "be the care<SPLIT>; Time urges<SPLIT>, now<SPLIT>, to perfect this affair<SPLIT>: Attend my counsel<SPLIT>, and the secret share<SPLIT>. When next the Sun his rising light displays<SPLIT>, And gilds the world below with purple rays<SPLIT>, The queen<SPLIT>, Aeneas<SPLIT>, and the Tyrian court Shall to the shady woods<SPLIT>, for sylvan game<SPLIT>, resort<SPLIT>. There<SPLIT>, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around<SPLIT>, And cheerful horns from side to side resound<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain With hail<SPLIT>, and thunder<SPLIT>, and tempestuous rain<SPLIT>; The fearful train shall take their speedy flight<SPLIT>, Dispers'd<SPLIT>, and all involv'd in gloomy night<SPLIT>; One cave a grateful shelter shall afford To the fair princess and the Trojan lord<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>will myself the bridal bed prepare<SPLIT>, If you<SPLIT>, to bless the nuptials<SPLIT>, will be there<SPLIT>: So shall their loves be crown'd with due delights<SPLIT>, And Hymen shall be present at the rites<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The Queen of Love consents<SPLIT>, and closely smiles At her vain project<SPLIT>, and discover'd wiles<SPLIT>.
The rosy morn was risen from the main<SPLIT>, And horns and hounds awake the princely train<SPLIT>: They issue early thro<SPLIT>' the city gate<SPLIT>, Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait<SPLIT>, With nets<SPLIT>, and toils<SPLIT>, and darts<SPLIT>, beside the force Of Spartan dogs<SPLIT>, and swift Massylian horse<SPLIT>. The Tyrian peers and officers of state For the slow queen in antechambers wait<SPLIT>; Her lofty courser<SPLIT>, in the court below<SPLIT>, Who his majestic rider seems to know<SPLIT>, Proud of his purple trappings<SPLIT>, paws the ground<SPLIT>, And champs the golden bit<SPLIT>, and spreads the foam around<SPLIT>. The queen at length appears<SPLIT>; on either hand The brawny guards in martial order stand<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>flow<SPLIT>'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore<SPLIT>, And at her back a golden quiver bore<SPLIT>; Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains<SPLIT>. Then young Ascanius<SPLIT>, with a sprightly grace<SPLIT>, Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase<SPLIT>. But far above the rest in beauty shines The great Aeneas<SPLIT>, the troop he joins<SPLIT>; Like fair Apollo<SPLIT>, when he leaves the frost Of wint<SPLIT>'ry Xanthus<SPLIT>, and the Lycian coast<SPLIT>, When to his native Delos he resorts<SPLIT>, Ordains the dances<SPLIT>, and renews the sports<SPLIT>; Where painted Scythians<SPLIT>, mix'd with Cretan bands<SPLIT>, Before the joyful altars join their hands<SPLIT>: Himself<SPLIT>, on Cynthus walking<SPLIT>, sees below The merry madness of the sacred show<SPLIT>. Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>golden fillet binds his awful brows<SPLIT>; His quiver sounds<SPLIT>: not less the prince is seen In manly presence<SPLIT>, or in lofty mien<SPLIT>.
Now had they reach'd the hills<SPLIT>, and storm'd the seat Of salvage beasts<SPLIT>, in dens<SPLIT>, their last retreat<SPLIT>. The cry pursues the mountain goats<SPLIT>: they bound From rock to rock<SPLIT>, and keep the craggy ground<SPLIT>; Quite otherwise the stags<SPLIT>, a trembling train<SPLIT>, In herds unsingled<SPLIT>, scour the dusty plain<SPLIT>, And a long chase in open view maintain<SPLIT>. The glad Ascanius<SPLIT>, as his courser guides<SPLIT>, Spurs thro<SPLIT>' the vale<SPLIT>, and these and those outrides<SPLIT>. His horse<SPLIT>'s flanks and sides are forc'd to feel The clanking lash<SPLIT>, and goring of the steel<SPLIT>. Impatiently he views the feeble prey<SPLIT>, Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way<SPLIT>, And rather would the tusky boar attend<SPLIT>, Or see the tawny lion downward bend<SPLIT>.
Meantime<SPLIT>, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies<SPLIT>: From pole to pole the forky lightning flies<SPLIT>; The rattling thunders roll<SPLIT>; and Juno pours A<SPLIT>wintry deluge down<SPLIT>, and sounding show<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>. The company<SPLIT>, dispers'd<SPLIT>, to converts ride<SPLIT>, And seek the homely cots<SPLIT>, or mountain<SPLIT>'s hollow side<SPLIT>. The rapid rains<SPLIT>, descending from the hills<SPLIT>, To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills<SPLIT>. The queen and prince<SPLIT>, as love or fortune guides<SPLIT>, One common cavern in her bosom hides<SPLIT>. Then first the trembling earth the signal gave<SPLIT>, And flashing fires enlighten all the cave<SPLIT>; Hell from below<SPLIT>, and Juno from above<SPLIT>, And howling nymphs<SPLIT>, were conscious of their love<SPLIT>. From this ill-omen'd hour in time arose Debate and death<SPLIT>, and all succeeding woes<SPLIT>.
The queen<SPLIT>, whom sense of honor could not move<SPLIT>, No longer made a secret of her love<SPLIT>, But call'd it marriage<SPLIT>, by that specious name To veil the crime and sanctify the shame<SPLIT>.
The loud report thro<SPLIT>' Libyan cities goes<SPLIT>. Fame<SPLIT>, the great ill<SPLIT>, from small beginnings grows<SPLIT>: Swift from the first<SPLIT>; and ev'ry moment brings New vigor to her flights<SPLIT>, new pinions to her wings<SPLIT>. Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size<SPLIT>; Her feet on earth<SPLIT>, her forehead in the skies<SPLIT>. Inrag'd against the gods<SPLIT>, revengeful Earth Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth<SPLIT>. Swift is her walk<SPLIT>, more swift her winged haste<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>monstrous phantom<SPLIT>, horrible and vast<SPLIT>. As many plumes as raise her lofty flight<SPLIT>, So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight<SPLIT>; Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong<SPLIT>, And ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue<SPLIT>, And round with list<SPLIT>'ning ears the flying plague is hung<SPLIT>. She fills the peaceful universe with cries<SPLIT>; No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes<SPLIT>; By day<SPLIT>, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews<SPLIT>, And spreads thro<SPLIT>' trembling crowds disastrous news<SPLIT>; With court informers haunts<SPLIT>, and royal spies<SPLIT>; Things done relates<SPLIT>, not done she feigns<SPLIT>, and mingles truth with lies<SPLIT>.
Talk is her business<SPLIT>, and her chief delight To tell of prodigies and cause affright<SPLIT>. She fills the people<SPLIT>'s ears with Dido<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, lost to honor and the sense of shame<SPLIT>, Admits into her throne and nuptial bed A<SPLIT>wand<SPLIT>'ring guest<SPLIT>, who from his country fled<SPLIT>: Whole days with him she passes in delights<SPLIT>, And wastes in luxury long winter nights<SPLIT>, Forgetful of her fame and royal trust<SPLIT>, Dissolv'd in ease<SPLIT>, abando<SPLIT>n'd to her lust<SPLIT>.
The goddess widely spreads the loud report<SPLIT>, And flies at length to King Hyarba<SPLIT>'s court<SPLIT>. When first possess'd with this unwelcome news Whom did he not of men and gods accuse<SPLIT>? This prince<SPLIT>, from ravish'd Garamantis born<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>hundred temples did with spoils adorn<SPLIT>, In Ammon<SPLIT>'s honor<SPLIT>, his celestial sire<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>hundred altars fed with wakeful fire<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' his vast dominions<SPLIT>, priests ordain'd<SPLIT>, Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd<SPLIT>. The gates and columns were with garlands crown'd<SPLIT>, And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground<SPLIT>.
He<SPLIT>, when he heard a fugitive could move The Tyrian princess<SPLIT>, who disdain'd his love<SPLIT>, His breast with fury burn'd<SPLIT>, his eyes with fire<SPLIT>, Mad with despair<SPLIT>, impatient with desire<SPLIT>; Then on the sacred altars pouring wine<SPLIT>, He thus with pray<SPLIT>'rs implor'd his sire divine<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Great Jove<SPLIT>! propitious to the Moorish race<SPLIT>, Who feast on painted beds<SPLIT>, with off'rings grace Thy temples<SPLIT>, and adore thy pow'r divine With blood of victims<SPLIT>, and with sparkling wine<SPLIT>, Seest thou not this<SPLIT>? or do we fear in vain Thy boasted thunder<SPLIT>, and thy thoughtless reign<SPLIT>? Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance<SPLIT>? Thine are the bolts<SPLIT>, or the blind work of chance<SPLIT>? A<SPLIT>wand<SPLIT>'ring woman builds<SPLIT>, within our state<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>little town<SPLIT>, bought at an easy rate<SPLIT>; She pays me homage<SPLIT>, and my grants allow A<SPLIT>narrow space of Libyan lands to plow<SPLIT>; Yet<SPLIT>, scorning me<SPLIT>, by passion blindly led<SPLIT>, Admits a banish'd Trojan to her bed<SPLIT>! And now this other Paris<SPLIT>, with his train Of conquer'd cowards<SPLIT>, must in Afric reign<SPLIT>! (<SPLIT>Whom<SPLIT>, what they are<SPLIT>, their looks and garb confess<SPLIT>, Their locks with oil perfum'd<SPLIT>, their Lydian dress<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>) He takes the spoil<SPLIT>, enjoys the princely dame<SPLIT>; And I<SPLIT>, rejected I<SPLIT>, adore an empty name<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
His vows<SPLIT>, in haughty terms<SPLIT>, he thus preferr'd<SPLIT>, And held his altar<SPLIT>'s horns<SPLIT>. The mighty Thund<SPLIT>'rer heard<SPLIT>; Then cast his eyes on Carthage<SPLIT>, where he found The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd<SPLIT>, Lost in their loves<SPLIT>, insensible of shame<SPLIT>, And both forgetful of their better fame<SPLIT>. He calls Cyllenius<SPLIT>, and the god attends<SPLIT>, By whom his menacing command he sends<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Go<SPLIT>, mount the western winds<SPLIT>, and cleave the sky<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, with a swift descent<SPLIT>, to Carthage fly<SPLIT>: There find the Trojan chief<SPLIT>, who wastes his days In slothful riot and inglorious ease<SPLIT>, Nor minds the future city<SPLIT>, giv'n by fate<SPLIT>. To him this message from my mouth relate<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Not so fair Venus hop'd<SPLIT>, when twice she won Thy life with pray<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, nor promis'd such a son<SPLIT>. Hers was a hero<SPLIT>, destin'd to command A<SPLIT>martial race<SPLIT>, and rule the Latian land<SPLIT>, Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw<SPLIT>, And on the conquer'd world impose the law<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' If glory cannot move a mind so mean<SPLIT>, Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean<SPLIT>, Yet why should he defraud his son of fame<SPLIT>, And grudge the Romans their immortal name<SPLIT>! What are his vain designs<SPLIT>! what hopes he more From his long ling<SPLIT>'ring on a hostile shore<SPLIT>, Regardless to redeem his honor lost<SPLIT>, And for his race to gain th<SPLIT>' Ausonian coast<SPLIT>! Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake<SPLIT>; With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Hermes obeys<SPLIT>; with golden pinions binds His flying feet<SPLIT>, and mounts the western winds<SPLIT>: And<SPLIT>, whether o<SPLIT>'er the seas or earth he flies<SPLIT>, With rapid force they bear him down the skies<SPLIT>. But first he grasps within his awful hand The mark of sov'reign pow'r<SPLIT>, his magic wand<SPLIT>; With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves<SPLIT>; With this he drives them down the Stygian waves<SPLIT>; With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight<SPLIT>, And eyes<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' clos'd in death<SPLIT>, restores to light<SPLIT>. Thus arm'd<SPLIT>, the god begins his airy race<SPLIT>, And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space<SPLIT>; Now sees the tops of Atlas<SPLIT>, as he flies<SPLIT>, Whose brawny back supports the starry skies<SPLIT>; Atlas<SPLIT>, whose head<SPLIT>, with piny forests crown'd<SPLIT>, Is beaten by the winds<SPLIT>, with foggy vapors bound<SPLIT>. Snows hide his shoulders<SPLIT>; from beneath his chin The founts of rolling streams their race begin<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>beard of ice on his large breast depends<SPLIT>. Here<SPLIT>, pois'd upon his wings<SPLIT>, the god descends<SPLIT>: Then<SPLIT>, rested thus<SPLIT>, he from the tow'ring height Plung'd downward<SPLIT>, with precipitated flight<SPLIT>, Lights on the seas<SPLIT>, and skims along the flood<SPLIT>. As waterfowl<SPLIT>, who seek their fishy food<SPLIT>, Less<SPLIT>, and yet less<SPLIT>, to distant prospect show<SPLIT>; By turns they dance aloft<SPLIT>, and dive below<SPLIT>: Like these<SPLIT>, the steerage of his wings he plies<SPLIT>, And near the surface of the water flies<SPLIT>, Till<SPLIT>, having pass'd the seas<SPLIT>, and cross'd the sands<SPLIT>, He clos'd his wings<SPLIT>, and stoop'd on Libyan lands<SPLIT>: Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds<SPLIT>, Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads<SPLIT>. Arriving there<SPLIT>, he found the Trojan prince New ramparts raising for the town<SPLIT>'s defense<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>purple scarf<SPLIT>, with gold embroider'd o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Queen Dido<SPLIT>'s gift<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) about his waist he wore<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>sword<SPLIT>, with glitt<SPLIT>'ring gems diversified<SPLIT>, For ornament<SPLIT>, not use<SPLIT>, hung idly by his side<SPLIT>.
Then thus<SPLIT>, with winged words<SPLIT>, the god began<SPLIT>, Resuming his own shape<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Degenerate man<SPLIT>, Thou woman<SPLIT>'s property<SPLIT>, what mak<SPLIT>'st thou here<SPLIT>, These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear<SPLIT>, Forgetful of thy own<SPLIT>? All-pow'rful Jove<SPLIT>, Who sways the world below and heav'n above<SPLIT>, Has sent me down with this severe command<SPLIT>: What means thy ling<SPLIT>'ring in the Libyan land<SPLIT>? If glory cannot move a mind so mean<SPLIT>, Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean<SPLIT>, Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir<SPLIT>: The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear<SPLIT>, To whom th<SPLIT>' Ausonian scepter<SPLIT>, and the state Of Rome<SPLIT>'s imperial name is ow'd by fate<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" So spoke the god<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, speaking<SPLIT>, took his flight<SPLIT>, Involv'd in clouds<SPLIT>, and vanish'd out of sight<SPLIT>.
The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear<SPLIT>; Mute was his tongue<SPLIT>, and upright stood his hair<SPLIT>. Revolving in his mind the stern command<SPLIT>, He longs to fly<SPLIT>, and loathes the charming land<SPLIT>. What should he say<SPLIT>? or how should he begin<SPLIT>? What course<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! remains to steer between Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen<SPLIT>? This way and that he turns his anxious mind<SPLIT>, And all expedients tries<SPLIT>, and none can find<SPLIT>. Fix'd on the deed<SPLIT>, but doubtful of the means<SPLIT>, After long thought<SPLIT>, to this advice he leans<SPLIT>: Three chiefs he calls<SPLIT>, commands them to repair The fleet<SPLIT>, and ship their men with silent care<SPLIT>; Some plausible pretense he bids them find<SPLIT>, To color what in secret he design'd<SPLIT>. Himself<SPLIT>, meantime<SPLIT>, the softest hours would choose<SPLIT>, Before the love-sick lady heard the news<SPLIT>; And move her tender mind<SPLIT>, by slow degrees<SPLIT>, To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees<SPLIT>: Jove will inspire him<SPLIT>, when<SPLIT>, and what to say<SPLIT>. They hear with pleasure<SPLIT>, and with haste obey<SPLIT>.
But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise<SPLIT>: (<SPLIT>What arts can blind a jealous woman<SPLIT>'s eyes<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>) She was the first to find the secret fraud<SPLIT>, Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad<SPLIT>. Love the first motions of the lover hears<SPLIT>, Quick to presage<SPLIT>, and ev'n in safety fears<SPLIT>. Nor impious Fame was wanting to report The ships repair'd<SPLIT>, the Trojans<SPLIT>' thick resort<SPLIT>, And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court<SPLIT>. Frantic with fear<SPLIT>, impatient of the wound<SPLIT>, And impotent of mind<SPLIT>, she roves the city round<SPLIT>. Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear<SPLIT>, When<SPLIT>, from afar<SPLIT>, their nightly god they hear<SPLIT>, And howl about the hills<SPLIT>, and shake the wreathy spear<SPLIT>. At length she finds the dear perfidious man<SPLIT>; Prevents his form'd excuse<SPLIT>, and thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Base and ungrateful<SPLIT>! could you hope to fly<SPLIT>, And undiscover'd scape a lover<SPLIT>'s eye<SPLIT>? Nor could my kindness your compassion move<SPLIT>. Nor plighted vows<SPLIT>, nor dearer bands of love<SPLIT>? Or is the death of a despairing queen Not worth preventing<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' too well foreseen<SPLIT>? Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay<SPLIT>, You dare the tempests<SPLIT>, and defy the sea<SPLIT>. False as you are<SPLIT>, suppose you were not bound To lands unknown<SPLIT>, and foreign coasts to sound<SPLIT>; Were Troy restor'd<SPLIT>, and Priam<SPLIT>'s happy reign<SPLIT>, Now durst you tempt<SPLIT>, for Troy<SPLIT>, the raging main<SPLIT>? See whom you fly<SPLIT>! am I the foe you shun<SPLIT>? Now<SPLIT>, by those holy vows<SPLIT>, so late begun<SPLIT>, By this right hand<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>since I have nothing more To challenge<SPLIT>, but the faith you gave before<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>) I<SPLIT>beg you by these tears too truly shed<SPLIT>, By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed<SPLIT>; If ever Dido<SPLIT>, when you most were kind<SPLIT>, Were pleasing in your eyes<SPLIT>, or touch'd your mind<SPLIT>; By these my pray<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, if pray<SPLIT>'rs may yet have place<SPLIT>, Pity the fortunes of a falling race<SPLIT>. For you I have provok'd a tyrant<SPLIT>'s hate<SPLIT>, Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state<SPLIT>; For you alone I suffer in my fame<SPLIT>, Bereft of honor<SPLIT>, and expos'd to shame<SPLIT>. Whom have I now to trust<SPLIT>, ungrateful guest<SPLIT>? (<SPLIT>That only name remains of all the rest<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>) What have I left<SPLIT>? or whither can I fly<SPLIT>? Must I attend Pygmalion<SPLIT>'s cruelty<SPLIT>, Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead A<SPLIT>queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed<SPLIT>? Had you deferr'd<SPLIT>, at least<SPLIT>, your hasty flight<SPLIT>, And left behind some pledge of our delight<SPLIT>, Some babe to bless the mother<SPLIT>'s mournful sight<SPLIT>, Some young Aeneas<SPLIT>, to supply your place<SPLIT>, Whose features might express his father<SPLIT>'s face<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>should not then complain to live bereft Of all my husband<SPLIT>, or be wholly left<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Here paus'd the queen<SPLIT>. Unmov'd he holds his eyes<SPLIT>, By Jove<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>; nor suffer'd love to rise<SPLIT>, Tho<SPLIT>' heaving in his heart<SPLIT>; and thus at length replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Fair queen<SPLIT>, you never can enough repeat Your boundless favors<SPLIT>, or I own my debt<SPLIT>; Nor can my mind forget Eliza<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>, While vital breath inspires this mortal frame<SPLIT>. This only let me speak in my defense<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>never hop'd a secret flight from hence<SPLIT>, Much less pretended to the lawful claim Of sacred nuptials<SPLIT>, or a husband<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>. For<SPLIT>, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free<SPLIT>, And not submit my life to fate<SPLIT>'s decree<SPLIT>, My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore<SPLIT>, Those relics to review<SPLIT>, their dust adore<SPLIT>, And Priam<SPLIT>'s ruin'd palace to restore<SPLIT>. But now the Delphian oracle commands<SPLIT>, And fate invites me to the Latian lands<SPLIT>. That is the promis'd place to which I steer<SPLIT>, And all my vows are terminated there<SPLIT>. If you<SPLIT>, a Tyrian<SPLIT>, and a stranger born<SPLIT>, With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn<SPLIT>, Why may not we<SPLIT>- like you<SPLIT>, a foreign race<SPLIT>- Like you<SPLIT>, seek shelter in a foreign place<SPLIT>? As often as the night obscures the skies With humid shades<SPLIT>, or twinkling stars arise<SPLIT>, Anchises<SPLIT>' angry ghost in dreams appears<SPLIT>, Chides my delay<SPLIT>, and fills my soul with fears<SPLIT>; And young Ascanius justly may complain Of his defrauded and destin'd reign<SPLIT>. Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd<SPLIT>: Waking I saw him<SPLIT>, and his message heard<SPLIT>. From Jove he came commission'd<SPLIT>, heav'nly bright With radiant beams<SPLIT>, and manifest to sight (<SPLIT>The sender and the sent I both attest<SPLIT>) These walls he enter'd<SPLIT>, and those words express'd<SPLIT>. Fair queen<SPLIT>, oppose not what the gods command<SPLIT>; Forc'd by my fate<SPLIT>, I leave your happy land<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus while he spoke<SPLIT>, already she began<SPLIT>, With sparkling eyes<SPLIT>, to view the guilty man<SPLIT>; From head to foot survey'd his person o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>False as thou art<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, more than false<SPLIT>, forsworn<SPLIT>! Not sprung from noble blood<SPLIT>, nor goddess-born<SPLIT>, But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock<SPLIT>! And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck<SPLIT>! Why should I fawn<SPLIT>? what have I worse to fear<SPLIT>? Did he once look<SPLIT>, or lent a list<SPLIT>'ning ear<SPLIT>, Sigh'd when I sobb'd<SPLIT>, or shed one kindly tear?<SPLIT>- All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind<SPLIT>, So foul<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, which is worse<SPLIT>, 'tis hard to find<SPLIT>. Of man<SPLIT>'s injustice why should I complain<SPLIT>? The gods<SPLIT>, and Jove himself<SPLIT>, behold in vain Triumphant treason<SPLIT>; yet no thunder flies<SPLIT>, Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes<SPLIT>; Faithless is earth<SPLIT>, and faithless are the skies<SPLIT>! Justice is fled<SPLIT>, and Truth is now no more<SPLIT>! I<SPLIT>sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore<SPLIT>; With needful food his hungry Trojans fed<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>took the traitor to my throne and bed<SPLIT>: Fool that I was<SPLIT>- 't is little to repeat The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>rave<SPLIT>, I rave<SPLIT>! A god<SPLIT>'s command he pleads<SPLIT>, And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds<SPLIT>. Now Lycian lots<SPLIT>, and now the Delian god<SPLIT>, Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove<SPLIT>'s abode<SPLIT>, To warn him hence<SPLIT>; as if the peaceful state Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate<SPLIT>! But go<SPLIT>! thy flight no longer I detain- Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro<SPLIT>' the main<SPLIT>! Yet<SPLIT>, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow<SPLIT>, The faithless waves<SPLIT>, not half so false as thou<SPLIT>, Or secret sands<SPLIT>, shall sepulchers afford To thy proud vessels<SPLIT>, and their perjur'd lord<SPLIT>. Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>: Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame<SPLIT>, When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame<SPLIT>; Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep<SPLIT>: Her angry ghost<SPLIT>, arising from the deep<SPLIT>, Shall haunt thee waking<SPLIT>, and disturb thy sleep. At least my shade thy punishment shall know<SPLIT>, And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Abruptly here she stops<SPLIT>; then turns away Her loathing eyes<SPLIT>, and shuns the sight of day<SPLIT>. Amaz'd he stood<SPLIT>, revolving in his mind What speech to frame<SPLIT>, and what excuse to find<SPLIT>. Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led<SPLIT>, And softly laid her on her ivory bed<SPLIT>.
But good Aeneas<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' he much desir'd To give that pity which her grief requir'd<SPLIT>; Tho<SPLIT>' much he mourn'd<SPLIT>, and labor'd with his love<SPLIT>, Resolv'd at length<SPLIT>, obeys the will of Jove<SPLIT>; Reviews his forces<SPLIT>: they with early care Unmoor their vessels<SPLIT>, and for sea prepare<SPLIT>. The fleet is soon afloat<SPLIT>, in all its pride<SPLIT>, And well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride<SPLIT>. Then oaks for oars they fell'd<SPLIT>; or<SPLIT>, as they stood<SPLIT>, Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood<SPLIT>, Studious of flight<SPLIT>. The beach is cover'd o<SPLIT>'er With Trojan bands<SPLIT>, that blacken all the shore<SPLIT>: On ev'ry side are seen<SPLIT>, descending down<SPLIT>, Thick swarms of soldiers<SPLIT>, loaden from the town<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, in battalia<SPLIT>, march embodied ants<SPLIT>, Fearful of winter<SPLIT>, and of future wants<SPLIT>, T' invade the corn<SPLIT>, and to their cells convey The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey<SPLIT>. The sable troops<SPLIT>, along the narrow tracks<SPLIT>, Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs<SPLIT>: Some set their shoulders to the pond<SPLIT>'rous grain<SPLIT>; Some guard the spoil<SPLIT>; some lash the lagging train<SPLIT>; All ply their sev'ral tasks<SPLIT>, and equal toil sustain<SPLIT>.
What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore<SPLIT>, When<SPLIT>, from the tow'r<SPLIT>, she saw the cover'd shore<SPLIT>, And heard the shouts of sailors from afar<SPLIT>, Mix'd with the murmurs of the wat<SPLIT>'ry war<SPLIT>! All-pow'rful Love<SPLIT>! what changes canst thou cause In human hearts<SPLIT>, subjected to thy laws<SPLIT>! Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends<SPLIT>: To pray<SPLIT>'rs and mean submissions she descends<SPLIT>. No female arts or aids she left untried<SPLIT>, Nor counsels unexplor'd<SPLIT>, before she died<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Look<SPLIT>, Anna<SPLIT>! look<SPLIT>! the Trojans crowd to sea<SPLIT>; They spread their canvas<SPLIT>, and their anchors weigh<SPLIT>. The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind<SPLIT>, Invoke the sea gods<SPLIT>, and invite the wind<SPLIT>. Could I have thought this threat<SPLIT>'ning blow so near<SPLIT>, My tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear<SPLIT>. But do not you my last request deny<SPLIT>; With yon perfidious man your int<SPLIT>'rest try<SPLIT>, And bring me news<SPLIT>, if I must live or die<SPLIT>. You are his fav'rite<SPLIT>; you alone can find The dark recesses of his inmost mind<SPLIT>: In all his trusted secrets you have part<SPLIT>, And know the soft approaches to his heart<SPLIT>. Haste then<SPLIT>, and humbly seek my haughty foe<SPLIT>; Tell him<SPLIT>, I did not with the Grecians go<SPLIT>, Nor did my fleet against his friends employ<SPLIT>, Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy<SPLIT>, Nor mov'd with hands profane his father<SPLIT>'s dust<SPLIT>: Why should he then reject a suit so just<SPLIT>! Whom does he shun<SPLIT>, and whither would he fly<SPLIT>! Can he this last<SPLIT>, this only pray<SPLIT>'r deny<SPLIT>! Let him at least his dang<SPLIT>'rous flight delay<SPLIT>, Wait better winds<SPLIT>, and hope a calmer sea<SPLIT>. The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more<SPLIT>: Let him pursue the promis'd Latian shore<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>short delay is all I ask him now<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>pause of grief<SPLIT>, an interval from woe<SPLIT>, Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain Accustom'd sorrows<SPLIT>, and inur'd to pain<SPLIT>. If you in pity grant this one request<SPLIT>, My death shall glut the hatred of his breast<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This mournful message pious Anna bears<SPLIT>, And seconds with her own her sister<SPLIT>'s tears<SPLIT>: But all her arts are still employ'd in vain<SPLIT>; Again she comes<SPLIT>, and is refus'd again<SPLIT>. His harden'd heart nor pray<SPLIT>'rs nor threat<SPLIT>'nings move<SPLIT>; Fate<SPLIT>, and the god<SPLIT>, had stopp'd his ears to love<SPLIT>.
As<SPLIT>, when the winds their airy quarrel try<SPLIT>, Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky<SPLIT>, This way and that the mountain oak they bend<SPLIT>, His boughs they shatter<SPLIT>, and his branches rend<SPLIT>; With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground<SPLIT>; The hollow valleys echo to the sound<SPLIT>: Unmov'd<SPLIT>, the royal plant their fury mocks<SPLIT>, Or<SPLIT>, shaken<SPLIT>, clings more closely to the rocks<SPLIT>; Far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high<SPLIT>, So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie<SPLIT>. No less a storm the Trojan hero bears<SPLIT>; Thick messages and loud complaints he hears<SPLIT>, And bandied words<SPLIT>, still beating on his ears<SPLIT>. Sighs<SPLIT>, groans<SPLIT>, and tears proclaim his inward pains<SPLIT>; But the firm purpose of his heart remains<SPLIT>.
The wretched queen<SPLIT>, pursued by cruel fate<SPLIT>, Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate<SPLIT>, And loathes to live<SPLIT>. Then dire portents she sees<SPLIT>, To hasten on the death her soul decrees<SPLIT>: Strange to relate<SPLIT>! for when<SPLIT>, before the shrine<SPLIT>, She pours in sacrifice the purple wine<SPLIT>, The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood<SPLIT>, And the white offer'd milk converts to mud<SPLIT>. This dire presage<SPLIT>, to her alone reveal'd<SPLIT>, From all<SPLIT>, and ev'n her sister<SPLIT>, she conceal'd<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>marble temple stood within the grove<SPLIT>, Sacred to death<SPLIT>, and to her murther'd love<SPLIT>; That honor'd chapel she had hung around With snowy fleeces<SPLIT>, and with garlands crown'd<SPLIT>: Oft<SPLIT>, when she visited this lonely dome<SPLIT>, Strange voices issued from her husband<SPLIT>'s tomb<SPLIT>; She thought she heard him summon her away<SPLIT>, Invite her to his grave<SPLIT>, and chide her stay<SPLIT>. Hourly 't is heard<SPLIT>, when with a boding note The solitary screech owl strains her throat<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, on a chimney<SPLIT>'s top<SPLIT>, or turret<SPLIT>'s height<SPLIT>, With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, old prophecies augment her fears<SPLIT>; And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears<SPLIT>, Disdainful as by day<SPLIT>: she seems<SPLIT>, alone<SPLIT>, To wander in her sleep<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' ways unknown<SPLIT>, Guideless and dark<SPLIT>; or<SPLIT>, in a desart plain<SPLIT>, To seek her subjects<SPLIT>, and to seek in vain<SPLIT>: Like Pentheus<SPLIT>, when<SPLIT>, distracted with his fear<SPLIT>, He saw two suns<SPLIT>, and double Thebes<SPLIT>, appear<SPLIT>; Or mad Orestes<SPLIT>, when his mother<SPLIT>'s ghost Full in his face infernal torches toss'd<SPLIT>, And shook her snaky locks<SPLIT>: he shuns the sight<SPLIT>, Flies o<SPLIT>'er the stage<SPLIT>, surpris'd with mortal fright<SPLIT>; The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, sinking underneath a load of grief<SPLIT>, From death alone she seeks her last relief<SPLIT>; The time and means resolv'd within her breast<SPLIT>, She to her mournful sister thus address'd (<SPLIT>Dissembling hope<SPLIT>, her cloudy front she clears<SPLIT>, And a false vigor in her eyes appears<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Rejoice<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Instructed from above<SPLIT>, My lover I shall gain<SPLIT>, or lose my love<SPLIT>. Nigh rising Atlas<SPLIT>, next the falling sun<SPLIT>, Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run<SPLIT>: There a Massylian priestess I have found<SPLIT>, Honor'd for age<SPLIT>, for magic arts renown'd<SPLIT>: Th' Hesperian temple was her trusted care<SPLIT>; '<SPLIT>T was she supplied the wakeful dragon<SPLIT>'s fare<SPLIT>. She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep<SPLIT>, Reclaim'd his rage<SPLIT>, and sooth'd him into sleep. She watch'd the golden fruit<SPLIT>; her charms unbind The chains of love<SPLIT>, or fix them on the mind<SPLIT>: She stops the torrents<SPLIT>, leaves the channel dry<SPLIT>, Repels the stars<SPLIT>, and backward bears the sky<SPLIT>. The yawning earth rebellows to her call<SPLIT>, Pale ghosts ascend<SPLIT>, and mountain ashes fall<SPLIT>. Witness<SPLIT>, ye gods<SPLIT>, and thou my better part<SPLIT>, How loth I am to try this impious art<SPLIT>! Within the secret court<SPLIT>, with silent care<SPLIT>, Erect a lofty pile<SPLIT>, expos'd in air<SPLIT>: Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest<SPLIT>, Spoils<SPLIT>, arms<SPLIT>, and presents<SPLIT>, of my faithless guest<SPLIT>. Next<SPLIT>, under these<SPLIT>, the bridal bed be plac'd<SPLIT>, Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd<SPLIT>: All relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire<SPLIT>; For so the priestess and her charms require<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus far she said<SPLIT>, and farther speech forbears<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>mortal paleness in her face appears<SPLIT>: Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find The secret fun'ral in these rites design'd<SPLIT>; Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind<SPLIT>. Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well<SPLIT>, She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell<SPLIT>; Therefore obeys<SPLIT>. The fatal pile they rear<SPLIT>, Within the secret court<SPLIT>, expos'd in air<SPLIT>. The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high<SPLIT>, And garlands on the hollow spaces lie<SPLIT>. Sad cypress<SPLIT>, vervain<SPLIT>, yew<SPLIT>, compose the wreath<SPLIT>, And ev'ry baleful green denoting death<SPLIT>. The queen<SPLIT>, determin'd to the fatal deed<SPLIT>, The spoils and sword he left<SPLIT>, in order spread<SPLIT>, And the man<SPLIT>'s image on the nuptial bed<SPLIT>.
And now (<SPLIT>the sacred altars plac'd around<SPLIT>) The priestess enters<SPLIT>, with her hair unbound<SPLIT>, And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground<SPLIT>. Night<SPLIT>, Erebus<SPLIT>, and Chaos she proclaims<SPLIT>, And threefold Hecate<SPLIT>, with her hundred names<SPLIT>, And three Dianas<SPLIT>: next<SPLIT>, she sprinkles round With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground<SPLIT>; Culls hoary simples<SPLIT>, found by Phoebe<SPLIT>'s light<SPLIT>, With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night<SPLIT>; Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl<SPLIT>, And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal<SPLIT>, Robbing the mother<SPLIT>'s love<SPLIT>. The destin'd queen Observes<SPLIT>, assisting at the rites obscene<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>leaven'd cake in her devoted hands She holds<SPLIT>, and next the highest altar stands<SPLIT>: One tender foot was shod<SPLIT>, her other bare<SPLIT>; Girt was her gather'd gown<SPLIT>, and loose her hair<SPLIT>. Thus dress'd<SPLIT>, she summon'd<SPLIT>, with her dying breath<SPLIT>, The heav'ns and planets conscious of her death<SPLIT>, And ev'ry pow'r<SPLIT>, if any rules above<SPLIT>, Who minds<SPLIT>, or who revenges<SPLIT>, injur'd love<SPLIT>.
"'T was dead of night<SPLIT>, when weary bodies close Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose<SPLIT>: The winds no longer whisper thro<SPLIT>' the woods<SPLIT>, Nor murm<SPLIT>'ring tides disturb the gentle floods<SPLIT>. The stars in silent order mov'd around<SPLIT>; And Peace<SPLIT>, with downy wings<SPLIT>, was brooding on the ground The flocks and herds<SPLIT>, and party-color'd fowl<SPLIT>, Which haunt the woods<SPLIT>, or swim the weedy pool<SPLIT>, Stretch'd on the quiet earth<SPLIT>, securely lay<SPLIT>, Forgetting the past labors of the day<SPLIT>. All else of nature<SPLIT>'s common gift partake<SPLIT>: Unhappy Dido was alone awake<SPLIT>. Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find<SPLIT>; Sleep fled her eyes<SPLIT>, as quiet fled her mind<SPLIT>. Despair<SPLIT>, and rage<SPLIT>, and love divide her heart<SPLIT>; Despair and rage had some<SPLIT>, but love the greater part<SPLIT>.
Then thus she said within her secret mind<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What shall I do<SPLIT>? what succor can I find<SPLIT>? Become a suppliant to Hyarba<SPLIT>'s pride<SPLIT>, And take my turn<SPLIT>, to court and be denied<SPLIT>? Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go<SPLIT>, Forsake an empire<SPLIT>, and attend a foe<SPLIT>? Himself I refug'd<SPLIT>, and his train reliev'd<SPLIT>- '<SPLIT>T is true<SPLIT>- but am I sure to be receiv'd<SPLIT>? Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place<SPLIT>! Laomedon still lives in all his race<SPLIT>! Then<SPLIT>, shall I seek alone the churlish crew<SPLIT>, Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue<SPLIT>? What force have I but those whom scarce before I<SPLIT>drew reluctant from their native shore<SPLIT>? Will they again embark at my desire<SPLIT>, Once more sustain the seas<SPLIT>, and quit their second Tyre<SPLIT>? Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade<SPLIT>, And take the fortune thou thyself hast made<SPLIT>. Your pity<SPLIT>, sister<SPLIT>, first seduc'd my mind<SPLIT>, Or seconded too well what I design'd<SPLIT>. These dear-bought pleasures had I never known<SPLIT>, Had I continued free<SPLIT>, and still my own<SPLIT>; Avoiding love<SPLIT>, I had not found despair<SPLIT>, But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air<SPLIT>. Like them<SPLIT>, a lonely life I might have led<SPLIT>, Not mourn'd the living<SPLIT>, nor disturb'd the dead<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast<SPLIT>. On board<SPLIT>, the Trojan found more easy rest<SPLIT>. Resolv'd to sail<SPLIT>, in sleep he pass'd the night<SPLIT>; And order'd all things for his early flight<SPLIT>.
To whom once more the winged god appears<SPLIT>; His former youthful mien and shape he wears<SPLIT>, And with this new alarm invades his ears<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Sleep'st thou<SPLIT>, O goddess-born<SPLIT>! and canst thou drown Thy needful cares<SPLIT>, so near a hostile town<SPLIT>, Beset with foes<SPLIT>; nor hear<SPLIT>'st the western gales Invite thy passage<SPLIT>, and inspire thy sails<SPLIT>? She harbors in her heart a furious hate<SPLIT>, And thou shalt find the dire effects too late<SPLIT>; Fix'd on revenge<SPLIT>, and obstinate to die<SPLIT>. Haste swiftly hence<SPLIT>, while thou hast pow'r to fly<SPLIT>. The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore<SPLIT>. Prevent her rage<SPLIT>, while night obscures the skies<SPLIT>, And sail before the purple morn arise<SPLIT>. Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring<SPLIT>? Woman<SPLIT>'s a various and a changeful thing<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus Hermes in the dream<SPLIT>; then took his flight Aloft in air unseen<SPLIT>, and mix'd with night<SPLIT>.
Twice war<SPLIT>n'd by the celestial messenger<SPLIT>, The pious prince arose with hasty fear<SPLIT>; Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Haste to your banks<SPLIT>; your crooked anchors weigh<SPLIT>, And spread your flying sails<SPLIT>, and stand to sea<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>god commands<SPLIT>: he stood before my sight<SPLIT>, And urg'd us once again to speedy flight<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>sacred pow'r<SPLIT>, what pow'r soe<SPLIT>'er thou art<SPLIT>, To thy blest orders I resign my heart<SPLIT>. Lead thou the way<SPLIT>; protect thy Trojan bands<SPLIT>, And prosper the design thy will commands<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>: and<SPLIT>, drawing forth his flaming sword<SPLIT>, His thund<SPLIT>'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord<SPLIT>. An emulating zeal inspires his train<SPLIT>: They run<SPLIT>; they snatch<SPLIT>; they rush into the main<SPLIT>. With headlong haste they leave the desert shores<SPLIT>, And brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars<SPLIT>.
Aurora now had left her saffron bed<SPLIT>, And beams of early light the heav'ns o<SPLIT>'erspread<SPLIT>, When<SPLIT>, from a tow'r<SPLIT>, the queen<SPLIT>, with wakeful eyes<SPLIT>, Saw day point upward from the rosy skies<SPLIT>. She look'd to seaward<SPLIT>; but the sea was void<SPLIT>, And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried<SPLIT>. Stung with despite<SPLIT>, and furious with despair<SPLIT>, She struck her trembling breast<SPLIT>, and tore her hair<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>And shall th<SPLIT>' ungrateful traitor go<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>My land forsaken<SPLIT>, and my love betray'd<SPLIT>? Shall we not arm<SPLIT>? not rush from ev'ry street<SPLIT>, To follow<SPLIT>, sink<SPLIT>, and burn his perjur'd fleet<SPLIT>? Haste<SPLIT>, haul my galleys out<SPLIT>! pursue the foe<SPLIT>! Bring flaming brands<SPLIT>! set sail<SPLIT>, and swiftly row<SPLIT>! What have I said<SPLIT>? where am I<SPLIT>? Fury turns My brain<SPLIT>; and my distemper'd bosom burns<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, when I gave my person and my throne<SPLIT>, This hate<SPLIT>, this rage<SPLIT>, had been more timely shown<SPLIT>. See now the promis'd faith<SPLIT>, the vaunted name<SPLIT>, The pious man<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, rushing thro<SPLIT>' the flame<SPLIT>, Preserv'd his gods<SPLIT>, and to the Phrygian shore The burthen of his feeble father bore<SPLIT>! I<SPLIT>should have torn him piecemeal<SPLIT>; strow'd in floods His scatter'd limbs<SPLIT>, or left expos'd in woods<SPLIT>; Destroy'd his friends and son<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, from the fire<SPLIT>, Have set the reeking boy before the sire<SPLIT>. Events are doubtful<SPLIT>, which on battles wait<SPLIT>: Yet where<SPLIT>'s the doubt<SPLIT>, to souls secure of fate<SPLIT>? My Tyrians<SPLIT>, at their injur'd queen<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>, Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band<SPLIT>; At once extinguish'd all the faithless name<SPLIT>; And I myself<SPLIT>, in vengeance of my shame<SPLIT>, Had fall<SPLIT>'n upon the pile<SPLIT>, to mend the fun'ral flame<SPLIT>. Thou Sun<SPLIT>, who view<SPLIT>'st at once the world below<SPLIT>; Thou Juno<SPLIT>, guardian of the nuptial vow<SPLIT>; Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes<SPLIT>! Ye Furies<SPLIT>, fiends<SPLIT>, and violated gods<SPLIT>, All pow'rs invok'd with Dido<SPLIT>'s dying breath<SPLIT>, Attend her curses and avenge her death<SPLIT>! If so the Fates ordain<SPLIT>, Jove commands<SPLIT>, Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands<SPLIT>, Yet let a race untam'd<SPLIT>, and haughty foes<SPLIT>, His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose<SPLIT>: Oppress'd with numbers in th<SPLIT>' unequal field<SPLIT>, His men discourag'd<SPLIT>, and himself expell'd<SPLIT>, Let him for succor sue from place to place<SPLIT>, Torn from his subjects<SPLIT>, and his son<SPLIT>'s embrace<SPLIT>. First<SPLIT>, let him see his friends in battle slain<SPLIT>, And their untimely fate lament in vain<SPLIT>; And when<SPLIT>, at length<SPLIT>, the cruel war shall cease<SPLIT>, On hard conditions may he buy his peace<SPLIT>: Nor let him then enjoy supreme command<SPLIT>; But fall<SPLIT>, untimely<SPLIT>, by some hostile hand<SPLIT>, And lie unburied on the barren sand<SPLIT>! These are my pray<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, and this my dying will<SPLIT>; And you<SPLIT>, my Tyrians<SPLIT>, ev'ry curse fulfil<SPLIT>. Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim<SPLIT>, Against the prince<SPLIT>, the people<SPLIT>, and the name<SPLIT>. These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow<SPLIT>; Nor league<SPLIT>, nor love<SPLIT>, the hostile nations know<SPLIT>! Now<SPLIT>, and from hence<SPLIT>, in ev'ry future age<SPLIT>, When rage excites your arms<SPLIT>, and strength supplies the rage Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood<SPLIT>, With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood<SPLIT>; Our arms<SPLIT>, our seas<SPLIT>, our shores<SPLIT>, oppos'd to theirs<SPLIT>; And the same hate descend on all our heirs<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
This said<SPLIT>, within her anxious mind she weighs The means of cutting short her odious days<SPLIT>. Then to Sichaeus<SPLIT>' nurse she briefly said (<SPLIT>For<SPLIT>, when she left her country<SPLIT>, hers was dead<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Go<SPLIT>, Barce<SPLIT>, call my sister<SPLIT>. Let her care The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare<SPLIT>; The sheep<SPLIT>, and all th<SPLIT>' atoning off'rings bring<SPLIT>, Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring With living drops<SPLIT>; then let her come<SPLIT>, and thou With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow<SPLIT>. Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove<SPLIT>, And end the cares of my disastrous love<SPLIT>; Then cast the Trojan image on the fire<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, as that burns<SPLIT>, my passions shall expire<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
The nurse moves onward<SPLIT>, with officious care<SPLIT>, And all the speed her aged limbs can bear<SPLIT>. But furious Dido<SPLIT>, with dark thoughts involv'd<SPLIT>, Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd<SPLIT>. With livid spots distinguish'd was her face<SPLIT>; Red were her rolling eyes<SPLIT>, and discompos'd her pace<SPLIT>; Ghastly she gaz'd<SPLIT>, with pain she drew her breath<SPLIT>, And nature shiver'd at approaching death<SPLIT>.
Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd<SPLIT>, And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste<SPLIT>; Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind (<SPLIT>Not for so dire an enterprise design'd<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>. But when she view'd the garments loosely spread<SPLIT>, Which once he wore<SPLIT>, and saw the conscious bed<SPLIT>, She paus'd<SPLIT>, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd<SPLIT>; Then on the couch her trembling body cast<SPLIT>, Repress'd the ready tears<SPLIT>, and spoke her last<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Dear pledges of my love<SPLIT>, while Heav'n so pleas'd<SPLIT>, Receive a soul<SPLIT>, of mortal anguish eas'd<SPLIT>: My fatal course is finish'd<SPLIT>; and I go<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>glorious name<SPLIT>, among the ghosts below<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>lofty city by my hands is rais'd<SPLIT>, Pygmalion punish'd<SPLIT>, and my lord appeas'd<SPLIT>. What could my fortune have afforded more<SPLIT>, Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Then kiss'd the couch<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>Must I die<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>And unreveng'd<SPLIT>? '<SPLIT>T is doubly to be dead<SPLIT>! Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive<SPLIT>: On any terms<SPLIT>, 't is better than to live<SPLIT>. These flames<SPLIT>, from far<SPLIT>, may the false Trojan view<SPLIT>; These boding omens his base flight pursue<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
She said<SPLIT>, and struck<SPLIT>; deep enter'd in her side The piercing steel<SPLIT>, with reeking purple dyed<SPLIT>: Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands<SPLIT>; The spouting blood came streaming on her hands<SPLIT>. Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke<SPLIT>, And with loud cries the sounding palace shook<SPLIT>. Distracted<SPLIT>, from the fatal sight they fled<SPLIT>, And thro<SPLIT>' the town the dismal rumor spread<SPLIT>. First from the frighted court the yell began<SPLIT>; Redoubled<SPLIT>, thence from house to house it ran<SPLIT>: The groans of men<SPLIT>, with shrieks<SPLIT>, laments<SPLIT>, and cries Of mixing women<SPLIT>, mount the vaulted skies<SPLIT>. Not less the clamor<SPLIT>, than if<SPLIT>- ancient Tyre<SPLIT>, Or the new Carthage<SPLIT>, set by foes on fire<SPLIT>- The rolling ruin<SPLIT>, with their lov'd abodes<SPLIT>, Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods<SPLIT>.
Her sister hears<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, furious with despair<SPLIT>, She beats her breast<SPLIT>, and rends her yellow hair<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, calling on Eliza<SPLIT>'s name aloud<SPLIT>, Runs breathless to the place<SPLIT>, and breaks the crowd<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd<SPLIT>; These fires<SPLIT>, this fun'ral pile<SPLIT>, these altars rear'd<SPLIT>? Was all this train of plots contriv'd<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said she<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>All only to deceive unhappy me<SPLIT>? Which is the worst<SPLIT>? Didst thou in death pretend To scorn thy sister<SPLIT>, or delude thy friend<SPLIT>? Thy summon'd sister<SPLIT>, and thy friend<SPLIT>, had come<SPLIT>; One sword had serv'd us both<SPLIT>, one common tomb<SPLIT>: Was I to raise the pile<SPLIT>, the pow'rs invoke<SPLIT>, Not to be present at the fatal stroke<SPLIT>? At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me<SPLIT>, Thy town<SPLIT>, thy senate<SPLIT>, and thy colony<SPLIT>! Bring water<SPLIT>; bathe the wound<SPLIT>; while I in death Lay close my lips to hers<SPLIT>, and catch the flying breath<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This said<SPLIT>, she mounts the pile with eager haste<SPLIT>, And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd<SPLIT>; Her temples chaf'd<SPLIT>; and her own garments tore<SPLIT>, To stanch the streaming blood<SPLIT>, and cleanse the gore<SPLIT>. Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, fainting thrice<SPLIT>, fell grov'ling on the bed<SPLIT>; Thrice op'd her heavy eyes<SPLIT>, and sought the light<SPLIT>, But<SPLIT>, having found it<SPLIT>, sicken'd at the sight<SPLIT>, And clos'd her lids at last in endless night<SPLIT>.
Then Juno<SPLIT>, grieving that she should sustain A<SPLIT>death so ling<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>, and so full of pain<SPLIT>, Sent Iris down<SPLIT>, to free her from the strife Of lab'ring nature<SPLIT>, and dissolve her life<SPLIT>. For since she died<SPLIT>, not doom'd by Heav'n<SPLIT>'s decree<SPLIT>, Or her own crime<SPLIT>, but human casualty<SPLIT>, And rage of love<SPLIT>, that plung'd her in despair<SPLIT>, The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair<SPLIT>, Which Proserpine and they can only know<SPLIT>; Nor made her sacred to the shades below<SPLIT>. Downward the various goddess took her flight<SPLIT>, And drew a thousand colors from the light<SPLIT>; Then stood above the dying lover<SPLIT>'s head<SPLIT>, And said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>I thus devote thee to the dead<SPLIT>. This off'ring to th<SPLIT>' infernal gods I bear<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus while she spoke<SPLIT>, she cut the fatal hair<SPLIT>: The struggling soul was loos'd<SPLIT>, and life dissolv'd in air<SPLIT>.

Now<SPLIT>, when the following morn had chas'd away The flying stars<SPLIT>, and light restor'd the day<SPLIT>, Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around<SPLIT>, And thus bespoke them from a rising ground<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Offspring of heav'n<SPLIT>, divine Dardanian race<SPLIT>!

Now came the day desir'd<SPLIT>.

The trumpet<SPLIT>'s clangor then the feast proclaims<SPLIT>, And all prepare for their appointed games<SPLIT>. Four galleys first<SPLIT>, which equal rowers bear<SPLIT>, Advancing<SPLIT>, in the wat<SPLIT>'ry lists appear<SPLIT>. The speedy Dolphin<SPLIT>, that outstrips the wind<SPLIT>, Bore Mnestheus<SPLIT>, author of the Memmian kind<SPLIT>: Gyas the vast Chimaera<SPLIT>'s bulk commands<SPLIT>, Which rising<SPLIT>, like a tow'ring city stands<SPLIT>; Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar<SPLIT>; Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore<SPLIT>; Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar<SPLIT>. Sergesthus<SPLIT>, who began the Sergian race<SPLIT>, In the great Centaur took the leading place<SPLIT>; Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood<SPLIT>, From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood<SPLIT>.
Far in the sea<SPLIT>, against the foaming shore<SPLIT>, There stands a rock<SPLIT>: the raging billows roar Above his head in storms<SPLIT>; but<SPLIT>, when 't is clear<SPLIT>, Uncurl their ridgy backs<SPLIT>, and at his foot appear<SPLIT>. In peace below the gentle waters run<SPLIT>; The cormorants above lie basking in the sun<SPLIT>. On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight<SPLIT>, The mark to guide the mariners aright<SPLIT>. To bear with this<SPLIT>, the seamen stretch their oars<SPLIT>; Then round the rock they steer<SPLIT>, and seek the former shores<SPLIT>. The lots decide their place<SPLIT>. Above the rest<SPLIT>, Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest<SPLIT>; The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs Their temples crown<SPLIT>, and shade their sweaty brows<SPLIT>: Besmear'd with oil<SPLIT>, their naked shoulders shine<SPLIT>. All take their seats<SPLIT>, and wait the sounding sign<SPLIT>: They gripe their oars<SPLIT>; and ev'ry panting breast Is rais'd by turns with hope<SPLIT>, by turns with fear depress'd<SPLIT>. The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign<SPLIT>; At once they start<SPLIT>, advancing in a line<SPLIT>: With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies<SPLIT>; Lash'd with their oars<SPLIT>, the smoky billows rise<SPLIT>; Sparkles the briny main<SPLIT>, and the vex'd ocean fries<SPLIT>. Exact in time<SPLIT>, with equal strokes they row<SPLIT>: At once the brushing oars and brazen prow Dash up the sandy waves<SPLIT>, and ope the depths below<SPLIT>. Not fiery coursers<SPLIT>, in a chariot race<SPLIT>, Invade the field with half so swift a pace<SPLIT>; Not the fierce driver with more fury lends The sounding lash<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, ere the stroke descends<SPLIT>, Low to the wheels his pliant body bends<SPLIT>. The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide<SPLIT>, And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side<SPLIT>. Cries<SPLIT>, murmurs<SPLIT>, clamors<SPLIT>, with a mixing sound<SPLIT>, From woods to woods<SPLIT>, from hills to hills rebound<SPLIT>.
Amidst the loud applauses of the shore<SPLIT>, Gyas outstripp'd the rest<SPLIT>, and sprung before<SPLIT>: Cloanthus<SPLIT>, better mann'd<SPLIT>, pursued him fast<SPLIT>, But his o<SPLIT>'er-masted galley check'd his haste<SPLIT>. The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine With equal oars<SPLIT>, advancing in a line<SPLIT>; And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead<SPLIT>, And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead<SPLIT>; Now board to board the rival vessels row<SPLIT>, The billows lave the skies<SPLIT>, and ocean groans below<SPLIT>. They reach'd the mark<SPLIT>. Proud Gyas and his train In triumph rode<SPLIT>, the victors of the main<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, steering round<SPLIT>, he charg'd his pilot stand More close to shore<SPLIT>, and skim along the sand<SPLIT>- "<SPLIT>Let others bear to sea<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Menoetes heard<SPLIT>; But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, fearing<SPLIT>, sought the deep<SPLIT>; and still aloof he steer'd<SPLIT>. With louder cries the captain call'd again<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Bear to the rocky shore<SPLIT>, and shun the main<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He spoke<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, speaking<SPLIT>, at his stern he saw The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw<SPLIT>. Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood<SPLIT>, And in a closer compass plow'd the flood<SPLIT>. He pass'd the mark<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, wheeling<SPLIT>, got before<SPLIT>: Gyas blasphem'd the gods<SPLIT>, devoutly swore<SPLIT>, Cried out for anger<SPLIT>, and his hair he tore<SPLIT>. Mindless of others<SPLIT>' lives (<SPLIT>so high was grown His rising rage<SPLIT>) and careless of his own<SPLIT>, The trembling dotard to the deck he drew<SPLIT>; Then hoisted up<SPLIT>, and overboard he threw<SPLIT>: This done<SPLIT>, he seiz'd the helm<SPLIT>; his fellows cheer'd<SPLIT>, Turn'd short upon the shelfs<SPLIT>, and madly steer'd<SPLIT>.
Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears<SPLIT>, Clogg'd with his clothes<SPLIT>, and cumber'd with his years<SPLIT>: Now dropping wet<SPLIT>, he climbs the cliff with pain<SPLIT>. The crowd<SPLIT>, that saw him fall and float again<SPLIT>, Shout from the distant shore<SPLIT>; and loudly laugh'd<SPLIT>, To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught<SPLIT>. The following Centaur<SPLIT>, and the Dolphin<SPLIT>'s crew<SPLIT>, Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew<SPLIT>; While Gyas lags<SPLIT>, they kindle in the race<SPLIT>, To reach the mark<SPLIT>. Sergesthus takes the place<SPLIT>; Mnestheus pursues<SPLIT>; and while around they wind<SPLIT>, Comes up<SPLIT>, not half his galley<SPLIT>'s length behind<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, on the deck<SPLIT>, amidst his mates appear'd<SPLIT>, And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>My friends<SPLIT>, and Hector<SPLIT>'s followers heretofore<SPLIT>, Exert your vigor<SPLIT>; tug the lab'ring oar<SPLIT>; Stretch to your strokes<SPLIT>, my still unconquer'd crew<SPLIT>, Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew<SPLIT>. In this<SPLIT>, our common int<SPLIT>'rest<SPLIT>, let me find That strength of hand<SPLIT>, that courage of the mind<SPLIT>, As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er the Syrtes<SPLIT>' broken billows row'd<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>seek not now the foremost palm to gain<SPLIT>; Tho<SPLIT>' yet<SPLIT>- but<SPLIT>, ah<SPLIT>! that haughty wish is vain<SPLIT>! Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain<SPLIT>. But to be last<SPLIT>, the lags of all the race!<SPLIT>- Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Now<SPLIT>, one and all<SPLIT>, they tug amain<SPLIT>; they row At the full stretch<SPLIT>, and shake the brazen prow<SPLIT>. The sea beneath 'em sinks<SPLIT>; their lab'ring sides Are swell'd<SPLIT>, and sweat runs gutt<SPLIT>'ring down in tides<SPLIT>. Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success<SPLIT>; Sergesthus<SPLIT>, eager with his beak to press Betwixt the rival galley and the rock<SPLIT>, Shuts up th<SPLIT>' unwieldly Centaur in the lock<SPLIT>. The vessel struck<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, with the dreadful shock<SPLIT>, Her oars she shiver'd<SPLIT>, and her head she broke<SPLIT>. The trembling rowers from their banks arise<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, anxious for themselves<SPLIT>, renounce the prize<SPLIT>. With iron poles they heave her off the shores<SPLIT>, And gather from the sea their floating oars<SPLIT>. The crew of Mnestheus<SPLIT>, with elated minds<SPLIT>, Urge their success<SPLIT>, and call the willing winds<SPLIT>; Then ply their oars<SPLIT>, and cut their liquid way In larger compass on the roomy sea<SPLIT>. As<SPLIT>, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes<SPLIT>, Rous'd in a fright<SPLIT>, her sounding wings she shakes<SPLIT>; The cavern rings with clatt<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>; out she flies<SPLIT>, And leaves her callow care<SPLIT>, and cleaves the skies<SPLIT>: At first she flutters<SPLIT>; but at length she springs To smoother flight<SPLIT>, and shoots upon her wings<SPLIT>: So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, flying with a force<SPLIT>, that force assists his way<SPLIT>. Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd<SPLIT>, Wedg'd in the rocky shoals<SPLIT>, and sticking fast<SPLIT>. In vain the victor he with cries implores<SPLIT>, And practices to row with shatter'd oars<SPLIT>. Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas<SPLIT>, and outflies<SPLIT>: The ship<SPLIT>, without a pilot<SPLIT>, yields the prize<SPLIT>. Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains<SPLIT>; Her he pursues<SPLIT>, and all his vigor strains<SPLIT>. Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise<SPLIT>; Applauding Echo to the shouts replies<SPLIT>; Shouts<SPLIT>, wishes<SPLIT>, and applause run rattling thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>. These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard<SPLIT>, Much grudg'd the praise<SPLIT>, but more the robb'd reward<SPLIT>: Resolv'd to hold their own<SPLIT>, they mend their pace<SPLIT>, All obstinate to die<SPLIT>, or gain the race<SPLIT>. Rais'd with success<SPLIT>, the Dolphin swiftly ran<SPLIT>; For they can conquer<SPLIT>, who believe they can<SPLIT>. Both urge their oars<SPLIT>, and fortune both supplies<SPLIT>, And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize<SPLIT>; When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands<SPLIT>, And succor from the wat<SPLIT>'ry pow'rs demands<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Gods of the liquid realms<SPLIT>, on which I row<SPLIT>! If<SPLIT>, giv'n by you<SPLIT>, the laurel bind my brow<SPLIT>, Assist to make me guilty of my vow<SPLIT>! A<SPLIT>snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain<SPLIT>; His offer'd entrails cast into the main<SPLIT>, And ruddy wine<SPLIT>, from golden goblets thrown<SPLIT>, Your grateful gift and my return shall own<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The choir of nymphs<SPLIT>, and Phorcus<SPLIT>, from below<SPLIT>, With virgin Panopea<SPLIT>, heard his vow<SPLIT>; And old Portunus<SPLIT>, with his breadth of hand<SPLIT>, Push'd on<SPLIT>, and sped the galley to the land<SPLIT>. Swift as a shaft<SPLIT>, or winged wind<SPLIT>, she flies<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, darting to the port<SPLIT>, obtains the prize<SPLIT>.
The herald summons all<SPLIT>, and then proclaims Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games<SPLIT>. The prince with laurel crowns the victor<SPLIT>'s head<SPLIT>, And three fat steers are to his vessel led<SPLIT>, The ship<SPLIT>'s reward<SPLIT>; with gen'rous wine beside<SPLIT>, And sums of silver<SPLIT>, which the crew divide<SPLIT>. The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest<SPLIT>; The victor honor'd with a nobler vest<SPLIT>, Where gold and purple strive in equal rows<SPLIT>, And needlework its happy cost bestows<SPLIT>. There Ganymede is wrought with living art<SPLIT>, Chasing thro<SPLIT>' Ida<SPLIT>'s groves the trembling hart<SPLIT>: Breathless he seems<SPLIT>, yet eager to pursue<SPLIT>; When from aloft descends<SPLIT>, in open view<SPLIT>, The bird of Jove<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, sousing on his prey<SPLIT>, With crooked talons bears the boy away<SPLIT>. In vain<SPLIT>, with lifted hands and gazing eyes<SPLIT>, His guards behold him soaring thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>, And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries<SPLIT>.
Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, summon'd there<SPLIT>, the second prize he shard<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>coat of mail<SPLIT>, brave Demoleus bore<SPLIT>, More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore<SPLIT>, In single combat on the Trojan shore<SPLIT>: This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess<SPLIT>; In war for his defense<SPLIT>, for ornament in peace<SPLIT>. Rich was the gift<SPLIT>, and glorious to behold<SPLIT>, But yet so pond<SPLIT>'rous with its plates of gold<SPLIT>, That scarce two servants could the weight sustain<SPLIT>; Yet<SPLIT>, loaded thus<SPLIT>, Demoleus o<SPLIT>'er the plain Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train<SPLIT>. The third<SPLIT>, succeeding to the last reward<SPLIT>, Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd<SPLIT>, With figures prominent<SPLIT>, and richly wrought<SPLIT>, And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought<SPLIT>.
Thus all<SPLIT>, rewarded by the hero<SPLIT>'s hands<SPLIT>, Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands<SPLIT>; And now Sergesthus<SPLIT>, clearing from the rock<SPLIT>, Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock<SPLIT>. Forlorn she look'd<SPLIT>, without an aiding oar<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, houted by the vulgar<SPLIT>, made to shore<SPLIT>. As when a snake<SPLIT>, surpris'd upon the road<SPLIT>, Is crush'd athwart her body by the load Of heavy wheels<SPLIT>; or with a mortal wound Her belly bruis'd<SPLIT>, and trodden to the ground<SPLIT>: In vain<SPLIT>, with loosen'd curls<SPLIT>, she crawls along<SPLIT>; Yet<SPLIT>, fierce above<SPLIT>, she brandishes her tongue<SPLIT>; Glares with her eyes<SPLIT>, and bristles with her scales<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, groveling in the dust<SPLIT>, her parts unsound she trails<SPLIT>: So slowly to the port the Centaur tends<SPLIT>, But<SPLIT>, what she wants in oars<SPLIT>, with sails amends<SPLIT>. Yet<SPLIT>, for his galley sav'd<SPLIT>, the grateful prince Is pleas'd th<SPLIT>' unhappy chief to recompense<SPLIT>. Pholoe<SPLIT>, the Cretan slave<SPLIT>, rewards his care<SPLIT>, Beauteous herself<SPLIT>, with lovely twins as fair<SPLIT>.
From thence his way the Trojan hero bent Into the neighb'ring plain<SPLIT>, with mountains pent<SPLIT>, Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood<SPLIT>. Full in the midst of this fair valley stood A<SPLIT>native theater<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, rising slow By just degrees<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'erlook'd the ground below<SPLIT>. High on a sylvan throne the leader sate<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>num<SPLIT>'rous train attend in solemn state<SPLIT>. Here those that in the rapid course delight<SPLIT>, Desire of honor and the prize invite<SPLIT>. The rival runners without order stand<SPLIT>; The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band<SPLIT>. First Nisus<SPLIT>, with Euryalus<SPLIT>, appears<SPLIT>; Euryalus a boy of blooming years<SPLIT>, With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd<SPLIT>; Nisus<SPLIT>, for friendship to the youth renown'd<SPLIT>. Diores next<SPLIT>, of Priam<SPLIT>'s royal race<SPLIT>, Then Salius joined with Patron<SPLIT>, took their place<SPLIT>; (<SPLIT>But Patron in Arcadia had his birth<SPLIT>, And Salius his from Arcananian earth<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>) Then two Sicilian youths<SPLIT>- the names of these<SPLIT>, Swift Helymus<SPLIT>, and lovely Panopes<SPLIT>: Both jolly huntsmen<SPLIT>, both in forest bred<SPLIT>, And owning old Acestes for their head<SPLIT>; With sev'ral others of ignobler name<SPLIT>, Whom time has not deliver'd o<SPLIT>'er to fame<SPLIT>.
To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd<SPLIT>, In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>One common largess is for all design'd<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>silver-studded ax<SPLIT>, alike bestow'd<SPLIT>. The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed<SPLIT>: The first of these obtains a stately steed<SPLIT>, Adorn'd with trappings<SPLIT>; and the next in fame<SPLIT>, The quiver of an Amazonian dame<SPLIT>, With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>golden belt shall gird his manly side<SPLIT>, Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied<SPLIT>. The third this Grecian helmet shall content<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>. To their appointed base they went<SPLIT>; With beating hearts th<SPLIT>' expected sign receive<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, starting all at once<SPLIT>, the barrier leave<SPLIT>. Spread out<SPLIT>, as on the winged winds<SPLIT>, they flew<SPLIT>, And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view<SPLIT>. Shot from the crowd<SPLIT>, swift Nisus all o<SPLIT>'erpass'd<SPLIT>; Nor storms<SPLIT>, nor thunder<SPLIT>, equal half his haste<SPLIT>. The next<SPLIT>, but tho<SPLIT>' the next<SPLIT>, yet far disjoin'd<SPLIT>, Came Salius<SPLIT>, and Euryalus behind<SPLIT>; Then Helymus<SPLIT>, whom young Diores plied<SPLIT>, Step after step<SPLIT>, and almost side by side<SPLIT>, His shoulders pressing<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, in longer space<SPLIT>, Had won<SPLIT>, or left at least a dubious race<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, spent<SPLIT>, the goal they almost reach at last<SPLIT>, When eager Nisus<SPLIT>, hapless in his haste<SPLIT>, Slipp'd first<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, slipping<SPLIT>, fell upon the plain<SPLIT>, Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain<SPLIT>. The careless victor had not mark'd his way<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay<SPLIT>, His heels flew up<SPLIT>; and on the grassy floor He fell<SPLIT>, besmear'd with filth and holy gore<SPLIT>. Not mindless then<SPLIT>, Euryalus<SPLIT>, of thee<SPLIT>, Nor of the sacred bonds of amity<SPLIT>, He strove th<SPLIT>' immediate rival<SPLIT>'s hope to cross<SPLIT>, And caught the foot of Salius as he rose<SPLIT>. So Salius lay extended on the plain<SPLIT>; Euryalus springs out<SPLIT>, the prize to gain<SPLIT>, And leaves the crowd<SPLIT>: applauding peals attend The victor to the goal<SPLIT>, who vanquish'd by his friend<SPLIT>. Next Helymus<SPLIT>; and then Diores came<SPLIT>, By two misfortunes made the third in fame<SPLIT>.
But Salius enters<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, exclaiming loud For justice<SPLIT>, deafens and disturbs the crowd<SPLIT>; Urges his cause may in the court be heard<SPLIT>; And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd<SPLIT>. But favor for Euryalus appears<SPLIT>; His blooming beauty<SPLIT>, with his tender tears<SPLIT>, Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, Diores fills the court with cries<SPLIT>, Who vainly reaches at the last reward<SPLIT>, If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd<SPLIT>. Then thus the prince<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Let no disputes arise<SPLIT>: Where fortune plac'd it<SPLIT>, I award the prize<SPLIT>. But fortune<SPLIT>'s errors give me leave to mend<SPLIT>, At least to pity my deserving friend<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, from among the spoils<SPLIT>, he draws (<SPLIT>Pond<SPLIT>'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws<SPLIT>) A<SPLIT>lion<SPLIT>'s hide<SPLIT>: to Salius this he gives<SPLIT>. Nisus with envy sees the gift<SPLIT>, and grieves<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>and falling is to rise by you<SPLIT>, What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim<SPLIT>, Who merited the first rewards and fame<SPLIT>? In falling<SPLIT>, both an equal fortune tried<SPLIT>; Would fortune for my fall so well provide<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" With this he pointed to his face<SPLIT>, and show'd His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood<SPLIT>. Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd<SPLIT>, And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield<SPLIT>, Of wondrous art<SPLIT>, by Didymaon wrought<SPLIT>, Long since from Neptune<SPLIT>'s bars in triumph brought<SPLIT>. This giv'n to Nisus<SPLIT>, he divides the rest<SPLIT>, And equal justice in his gifts express'd<SPLIT>.
The race thus ended<SPLIT>, and rewards bestow'd<SPLIT>, Once more the prince bespeaks th<SPLIT>' attentive crowd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>If there he here whose dauntless courage dare In gauntlet-fight<SPLIT>, with limbs and body bare<SPLIT>, His opposite sustain in open view<SPLIT>, Stand forth the champion<SPLIT>, and the games renew<SPLIT>. Two prizes I propose<SPLIT>, and thus divide<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>bull with gilded horns<SPLIT>, and fillets tied<SPLIT>, Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>sword and helm shall cheer the loser<SPLIT>'s grief<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Then haughty Dares in the lists appears<SPLIT>; Stalking he strides<SPLIT>, his head erected bears<SPLIT>: His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield<SPLIT>, And loud applauses echo thro<SPLIT>' the field<SPLIT>. Dares alone in combat us'd to stand The match of mighty Paris<SPLIT>, hand to hand<SPLIT>; The same<SPLIT>, at Hector<SPLIT>'s fun'rals<SPLIT>, undertook Gigantic Butes<SPLIT>, of th<SPLIT>' Amycian stock<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, by the stroke of his resistless hand<SPLIT>, Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand<SPLIT>. Such Dares was<SPLIT>; and such he strode along<SPLIT>, And drew the wonder of the gazing throng<SPLIT>. His brawny back and ample breast he shows<SPLIT>, His lifted arms around his head he throws<SPLIT>, And deals in whistling air his empty blows<SPLIT>. His match is sought<SPLIT>; but<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' the trembling band<SPLIT>, Not one dares answer to the proud demand<SPLIT>. Presuming of his force<SPLIT>, with sparkling eyes Already he devours the promis'd prize<SPLIT>. He claims the bull with awless insolence<SPLIT>, And having seiz'd his horns<SPLIT>, accosts the prince<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>If none my matchless valor dares oppose<SPLIT>, How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes<SPLIT>? Permit me<SPLIT>, chief<SPLIT>, permit without delay<SPLIT>, To lead this uncontended gift away<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The crowd assents<SPLIT>, and with redoubled cries For the proud challenger demands the prize<SPLIT>.
Acestes<SPLIT>, fir'd with just disdain<SPLIT>, to see The palm usurp'd without a victory<SPLIT>, Reproach'd Entellus thus<SPLIT>, who sate beside<SPLIT>, And heard and saw<SPLIT>, unmov'd<SPLIT>, the Trojan<SPLIT>'s pride<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Once<SPLIT>, but in vain<SPLIT>, a champion of renown<SPLIT>, So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>prize in triumph borne before your sight<SPLIT>, And shun<SPLIT>, for fear<SPLIT>, the danger of the fight<SPLIT>? Where is our Eryx now<SPLIT>, the boasted name<SPLIT>, The god who taught your thund<SPLIT>'ring arm the game<SPLIT>? Where now your baffled honor<SPLIT>? Where the spoil That fill'd your house<SPLIT>, and fame that fill'd our isle<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" Entellus<SPLIT>, thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>My soul is still the same<SPLIT>, Unmov'd with fear<SPLIT>, and mov'd with martial fame<SPLIT>; But my chill blood is curdled in my veins<SPLIT>, And scarce the shadow of a man remains<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>could I turn to that fair prime again<SPLIT>, That prime of which this boaster is so vain<SPLIT>, The brave<SPLIT>, who this decrepid age defies<SPLIT>, Should feel my force<SPLIT>, without the promis'd prize<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, rising at the word<SPLIT>, he threw Two pond<SPLIT>'rous gauntlets down in open view<SPLIT>; Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield<SPLIT>, And sheathe his hands with in the listed field<SPLIT>. With fear and wonder seiz'd<SPLIT>, the crowd beholds The gloves of death<SPLIT>, with sev'n distinguish'd folds Of tough bull hides<SPLIT>; the space within is spread With iron<SPLIT>, or with loads of heavy lead<SPLIT>: Dares himself was daunted at the sight<SPLIT>, Renounc'd his challenge<SPLIT>, and refus'd to fight<SPLIT>. Astonish'd at their weight<SPLIT>, the hero stands<SPLIT>, And pois'd the pond<SPLIT>'rous engines in his hands<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>What had your wonder<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said Entellus<SPLIT>, "been<SPLIT>, Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen<SPLIT>, Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green<SPLIT>! These which I bear your brother Eryx bore<SPLIT>, Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore<SPLIT>. With these he long sustain'd th<SPLIT>' Herculean arm<SPLIT>; And these I wielded while my blood was warm<SPLIT>, This languish'd frame while better spirits fed<SPLIT>, Ere age unstrung my nerves<SPLIT>, or time o<SPLIT>'ersnow'd my head<SPLIT>. But if the challenger these arms refuse<SPLIT>, And cannot wield their weight<SPLIT>, or dare not use<SPLIT>; If great Aeneas and Acestes join In his request<SPLIT>, these gauntlets I resign<SPLIT>; Let us with equal arms perform the fight<SPLIT>, And let him leave to fear<SPLIT>, since I resign my right<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
This said<SPLIT>, Entellus for the strife prepares<SPLIT>; Stripp'd of his quilted coat<SPLIT>, his body bares<SPLIT>; Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>goodly tow'ring object on the sands<SPLIT>. Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied<SPLIT>, Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied<SPLIT>. Both on the tiptoe stand<SPLIT>, at full extent<SPLIT>, Their arms aloft<SPLIT>, their bodies inly bent<SPLIT>; Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar<SPLIT>; With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war<SPLIT>. One on his youth and pliant limbs relies<SPLIT>; One on his sinews and his giant size<SPLIT>. The last is stiff with age<SPLIT>, his motion slow<SPLIT>; He heaves for breath<SPLIT>, he staggers to and fro<SPLIT>, And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow<SPLIT>. Yet equal in success<SPLIT>, they ward<SPLIT>, they strike<SPLIT>; Their ways are diff'rent<SPLIT>, but their art alike<SPLIT>. Before<SPLIT>, behind<SPLIT>, the blows are dealt<SPLIT>; around Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>storm of strokes<SPLIT>, well meant<SPLIT>, with fury flies<SPLIT>, And errs about their temples<SPLIT>, ears<SPLIT>, and eyes<SPLIT>. Nor always errs<SPLIT>; for oft the gauntlet draws A<SPLIT>sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws<SPLIT>. Heavy with age<SPLIT>, Entellus stands his ground<SPLIT>, But with his warping body wards the wound<SPLIT>. His hand and watchful eye keep even pace<SPLIT>; While Dares traverses and shifts his place<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, like a captain who beleaguers round Some strong-built castle on a rising ground<SPLIT>, Views all th<SPLIT>' approaches with observing eyes<SPLIT>: This and that other part in vain he tries<SPLIT>, And more on industry than force relies<SPLIT>. With hands on high<SPLIT>, Entellus threats the foe<SPLIT>; But Dares watch'd the motion from below<SPLIT>, And slipp'd aside<SPLIT>, and shunn'd the long descending blow<SPLIT>. Entellus wastes his forces on the wind<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, thus deluded of the stroke design'd<SPLIT>, Headlong and heavy fell<SPLIT>; his ample breast And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd<SPLIT>. So falls a hollow pine<SPLIT>, that long had stood On Ida<SPLIT>'s height<SPLIT>, or Erymanthus<SPLIT>' wood<SPLIT>, Torn from the roots<SPLIT>. The diff'ring nations rise<SPLIT>, And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies<SPLIT>, Acestus runs with eager haste<SPLIT>, to raise The fall<SPLIT>'n companion of his youthful days<SPLIT>. Dauntless he rose<SPLIT>, and to the fight return'd<SPLIT>; With shame his glowing cheeks<SPLIT>, his eyes with fury burn'd<SPLIT>. Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast<SPLIT>, And with redoubled force his foe he press'd<SPLIT>. He lays on load with either hand<SPLIT>, amain<SPLIT>, And headlong drives the Trojan o<SPLIT>'er the plain<SPLIT>; Nor stops<SPLIT>, nor stays<SPLIT>; nor rest nor breath allows<SPLIT>; But storms of strokes descend about his brows<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>rattling tempest<SPLIT>, and a hail of blows<SPLIT>. But now the prince<SPLIT>, who saw the wild increase Of wounds<SPLIT>, commands the combatants to cease<SPLIT>, And bounds Entellus<SPLIT>' wrath<SPLIT>, and bids the peace<SPLIT>. First to the Trojan<SPLIT>, spent with toil<SPLIT>, he came<SPLIT>, And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>What fury seiz'd my friend<SPLIT>? The gods<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>To him propitious<SPLIT>, and averse to thee<SPLIT>, Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is madness to contend with strength divine<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The gauntlet fight thus ended<SPLIT>, from the shore His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore<SPLIT>: His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood<SPLIT>, And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood<SPLIT>. Faintly he stagger'd thro<SPLIT>' the hissing throng<SPLIT>, And hung his head<SPLIT>, and trail'd his legs along<SPLIT>. The sword and casque are carried by his train<SPLIT>; But with his foe the palm and ox remain<SPLIT>.
The champion<SPLIT>, then<SPLIT>, before Aeneas came<SPLIT>, Proud of his prize<SPLIT>, but prouder of his fame<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O goddess-born<SPLIT>, and you<SPLIT>, Dardanian host<SPLIT>, Mark with attention<SPLIT>, and forgive my boast<SPLIT>; Learn what I was<SPLIT>, by what remains<SPLIT>; and know From what impending fate you sav'd my foe<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Sternly he spoke<SPLIT>, and then confronts the bull<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, on his ample forehead aiming full<SPLIT>, The deadly stroke<SPLIT>, descending<SPLIT>, pierc'd the skull<SPLIT>. Down drops the beast<SPLIT>, nor needs a second wound<SPLIT>, But sprawls in pangs of death<SPLIT>, and spurns the ground<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>In Dares<SPLIT>' stead I offer this<SPLIT>. Eryx<SPLIT>, accept a nobler sacrifice<SPLIT>; Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield<SPLIT>: Thy gauntlets I resign<SPLIT>, and here renounce the field<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
This done<SPLIT>, Aeneas orders<SPLIT>, for the close<SPLIT>, The strife of archers with contending bows<SPLIT>. The mast Sergesthus<SPLIT>' shatter'd galley bore With his own hands he raises on the shore<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>flutt<SPLIT>'ring dove upon the top they tie<SPLIT>, The living mark at which their arrows fly<SPLIT>. The rival archers in a line advance<SPLIT>, Their turn of shooting to receive from chance<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>helmet holds their names<SPLIT>; the lots are drawn<SPLIT>: On the first scroll was read Hippocoon<SPLIT>. The people shout<SPLIT>. Upon the next was found Young Mnestheus<SPLIT>, late with naval honors crown'd<SPLIT>. The third contain'd Eurytion<SPLIT>'s noble name<SPLIT>, Thy brother<SPLIT>, Pandarus<SPLIT>, and next in fame<SPLIT>, Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound<SPLIT>, And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound<SPLIT>. Acestes in the bottom last remain'd<SPLIT>, Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd<SPLIT>. Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows<SPLIT>, And from the quiver each his arrow chose<SPLIT>. Hippocoon<SPLIT>'s was the first<SPLIT>: with forceful sway It flew<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, whizzing<SPLIT>, cut the liquid way<SPLIT>. Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands<SPLIT>: The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands<SPLIT>, And the tree trembled<SPLIT>, and the shouting cries Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies<SPLIT>. Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove<SPLIT>, With lifted eyes<SPLIT>, and took his aim above<SPLIT>, But made a glancing shot<SPLIT>, and missed the dove<SPLIT>; Yet miss'd so narrow<SPLIT>, that he cut the cord Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird<SPLIT>. The captive thus releas'd<SPLIT>, away she flies<SPLIT>, And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies<SPLIT>. His bow already bent<SPLIT>, Eurytion stood<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, having first invok'd his brother god<SPLIT>, His winged shaft with eager haste he sped<SPLIT>. The fatal message reach'd her as she fled<SPLIT>: She leaves her life aloft<SPLIT>; she strikes the ground<SPLIT>, And renders back the weapon in the wound<SPLIT>. Acestes<SPLIT>, grudging at his lot<SPLIT>, remains<SPLIT>, Without a prize to gratify his pains<SPLIT>. Yet<SPLIT>, shooting upward<SPLIT>, sends his shaft<SPLIT>, to show An archer<SPLIT>'s art<SPLIT>, and boast his twanging bow<SPLIT>. The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent<SPLIT>, And latter augurs judge from this event<SPLIT>. Chaf'd by the speed<SPLIT>, it fir'd<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, as it flew<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>trail of following flames ascending drew<SPLIT>: Kindling they mount<SPLIT>, and mark the shiny way<SPLIT>; Across the skies as falling meteors play<SPLIT>, And vanish into wind<SPLIT>, or in a blaze decay<SPLIT>. The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, trembling<SPLIT>, turn their wonder into pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>. The Dardan prince put on a smiling face<SPLIT>, And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest<SPLIT>, Turn'd the bad omen<SPLIT>, nor his fears confess'd<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>The gods<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>this miracle have wrought<SPLIT>, And order'd you the prize without the lot<SPLIT>. Accept this goblet<SPLIT>, rough with figur'd gold<SPLIT>, Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old<SPLIT>: This pledge of ancient amity receive<SPLIT>, Which to my second sire I justly give<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, with the trumpets<SPLIT>' cheerful sound<SPLIT>, Proclaim'd him victor<SPLIT>, and with laurel-crown'd<SPLIT>. Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize<SPLIT>, Tho<SPLIT>' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies<SPLIT>. Who cut the line<SPLIT>, with second gifts was grac'd<SPLIT>; The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast<SPLIT>.
The chief<SPLIT>, before the games were wholly done<SPLIT>, Call'd Periphantes<SPLIT>, tutor to his son<SPLIT>, And whisper'd thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>With speed Ascanius find<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, if his childish troop be ready join'd<SPLIT>, On horseback let him grace his grandsire<SPLIT>'s day<SPLIT>, And lead his equals arm'd in just array<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, calling out<SPLIT>, the cirque he clears<SPLIT>. The crowd withdrawn<SPLIT>, an open plain appears<SPLIT>. And now the noble youths<SPLIT>, of form divine<SPLIT>, Advance before their fathers<SPLIT>, in a line<SPLIT>; The riders grace the steeds<SPLIT>; the steeds with glory shine<SPLIT>.
Thus marching on in military pride<SPLIT>, Shouts of applause resound from side to side<SPLIT>. Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear<SPLIT>, Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear<SPLIT>. Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore<SPLIT>; Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before<SPLIT>. Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green<SPLIT>; Three graceful leaders at their head were seen<SPLIT>; Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief<SPLIT>, and left a space between<SPLIT>. The first young Priam led<SPLIT>; a lovely boy<SPLIT>, Whose grandsire was th<SPLIT>' unhappy king of Troy<SPLIT>; His race in after times was known to fame<SPLIT>, New honors adding to the Latian name<SPLIT>; And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became<SPLIT>. White were the fetlocks of his feet before<SPLIT>, And on his front a snowy star he bore<SPLIT>. Then beauteous Atys<SPLIT>, with Iulus bred<SPLIT>, Of equal age<SPLIT>, the second squadron led<SPLIT>. The last in order<SPLIT>, but the first in place<SPLIT>, First in the lovely features of his face<SPLIT>, Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed<SPLIT>, Queen Dido<SPLIT>'s gift<SPLIT>, and of the Tyrian breed<SPLIT>. Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains<SPLIT>, With golden bits adorn'd<SPLIT>, and purple reins<SPLIT>.
The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew<SPLIT>, And all the parents in the children view<SPLIT>; Their make<SPLIT>, their motions<SPLIT>, and their sprightly grace<SPLIT>, And hopes and fears alternate in their face<SPLIT>.
Th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train First make the circuit of the sandy plain Around their sires<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, at th<SPLIT>' appointed sign<SPLIT>, Drawn up in beauteous order<SPLIT>, form a line<SPLIT>. The second signal sounds<SPLIT>, the troop divides In three distinguish'd parts<SPLIT>, with three distinguish'd guides Again they close<SPLIT>, and once again disjoin<SPLIT>; In troop to troop oppos'd<SPLIT>, and line to line<SPLIT>. They meet<SPLIT>; they wheel<SPLIT>; they throw their darts afar With harmless rage and well-dissembled war<SPLIT>. Then in a round the mingled bodies run<SPLIT>: Flying they follow<SPLIT>, and pursuing shun<SPLIT>; Broken<SPLIT>, they break<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, rallying<SPLIT>, they renew In other forms the military shew<SPLIT>. At last<SPLIT>, in order<SPLIT>, undiscer<SPLIT>n'd they join<SPLIT>, And march together in a friendly line<SPLIT>. And<SPLIT>, as the Cretan labyrinth of old<SPLIT>, With wand<SPLIT>'ring ways and many a winding fold<SPLIT>, Involv'd the weary feet<SPLIT>, without redress<SPLIT>, In a round error<SPLIT>, which denied recess<SPLIT>; So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play<SPLIT>, Turn'd and return'd<SPLIT>, and still a diff'rent way<SPLIT>. Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase In circles<SPLIT>, when they swim around the wat<SPLIT>'ry race<SPLIT>. This game<SPLIT>, these carousels<SPLIT>, Ascanius taught<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, building Alba<SPLIT>, to the Latins brought<SPLIT>; Shew'd what he learn'd<SPLIT>: the Latin sires impart To their succeeding sons the graceful art<SPLIT>; From these imperial Rome receiv'd the game<SPLIT>, Which Troy<SPLIT>, the youths the Trojan troop<SPLIT>, they name<SPLIT>.
Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate<SPLIT>: But Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, while they pay the dead his annual dues<SPLIT>, Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views<SPLIT>; And sends the goddess of the various bow<SPLIT>, To try new methods of revenge below<SPLIT>; Supplies the winds to wing her airy way<SPLIT>, Where in the port secure the navy lay<SPLIT>. Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, undiscer<SPLIT>n'd<SPLIT>, her fatal voyage ends<SPLIT>. She saw the gath'ring crowd<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, gliding thence<SPLIT>, The desart shore<SPLIT>, and fleet without defense<SPLIT>. The Trojan matrons<SPLIT>, on the sands alone<SPLIT>, With sighs and tears Anchises<SPLIT>' death bemoan<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, turning to the sea their weeping eyes<SPLIT>, Their pity to themselves renews their cries<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Alas<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" said one<SPLIT>, "what oceans yet remain For us to sail<SPLIT>! what labors to sustain<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" All take the word<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, with a gen'ral groan<SPLIT>, Implore the gods for peace<SPLIT>, and places of their own<SPLIT>.
The goddess<SPLIT>, great in mischief<SPLIT>, views their pains<SPLIT>, And in a woman<SPLIT>'s form her heav'nly limbs restrains<SPLIT>. In face and shape old Beroe she became<SPLIT>, Doryclus<SPLIT>' wife<SPLIT>, a venerable dame<SPLIT>, Once blest with riches<SPLIT>, and a mother<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>. Thus chang'd<SPLIT>, amidst the crying crowd she ran<SPLIT>, Mix'd with the matrons<SPLIT>, and these words began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O wretched we<SPLIT>, whom not the Grecian pow'r<SPLIT>, Nor flames<SPLIT>, destroy'd<SPLIT>, in Troy<SPLIT>'s unhappy hour<SPLIT>! O<SPLIT>wretched we<SPLIT>, reserv'd by cruel fate<SPLIT>, Beyond the ruins of the sinking state<SPLIT>! Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run<SPLIT>, Since this improsp'rous voyage we begun<SPLIT>; Since<SPLIT>, toss'd from shores to shores<SPLIT>, from lands to lands<SPLIT>, Inhospitable rocks and barren sands<SPLIT>, Wand<SPLIT>'ring in exile thro<SPLIT>' the stormy sea<SPLIT>, We search in vain for flying Italy<SPLIT>. Now cast by fortune on this kindred land<SPLIT>, What should our rest and rising walls withstand<SPLIT>, Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band<SPLIT>? O<SPLIT>country lost<SPLIT>, and gods redeem'd in vain<SPLIT>, If still in endless exile we remain<SPLIT>! Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew<SPLIT>, Or streams of some dissembled Simois view<SPLIT>! Haste<SPLIT>, join with me<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' unhappy fleet consume<SPLIT>! Cassandra bids<SPLIT>; and I declare her doom<SPLIT>. In sleep I saw her<SPLIT>; she supplied my hands (<SPLIT>For this I more than dreamt<SPLIT>) with flaming brands<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>With these<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>' said she<SPLIT>, 'these wand<SPLIT>'ring ships destroy<SPLIT>: These are your fatal seats<SPLIT>, and this your Troy<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' Time calls you now<SPLIT>; the precious hour employ<SPLIT>: Slack not the good presage<SPLIT>, while Heav'n inspires Our minds to dare<SPLIT>, and gives the ready fires<SPLIT>. See<SPLIT>! Neptune<SPLIT>'s altars minister their brands<SPLIT>: The god is pleas'd<SPLIT>; the god supplies our hands<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, toss'd in air<SPLIT>, amidst the galleys threw<SPLIT>.
Wrapp'd in amaze<SPLIT>, the matrons wildly stare<SPLIT>: Then Pyrgo<SPLIT>, reverenc'd for her hoary hair<SPLIT>, Pyrgo<SPLIT>, the nurse of Priam<SPLIT>'s num<SPLIT>'rous race<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>No Beroe this<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' she belies her face<SPLIT>! What terrors from her frowning front arise<SPLIT>! Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes<SPLIT>! What rays around her heav'nly face are seen<SPLIT>! Mark her majestic voice<SPLIT>, and more than mortal mien<SPLIT>! Beroe but now I left<SPLIT>, whom<SPLIT>, pin'd with pain<SPLIT>, Her age and anguish from these rites detain<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" She said<SPLIT>. The matrons<SPLIT>, seiz'd with new amaze<SPLIT>, Roll their malignant eyes<SPLIT>, and on the navy gaze<SPLIT>. They fear<SPLIT>, and hope<SPLIT>, and neither part obey<SPLIT>: They hope the fated land<SPLIT>, but fear the fatal way<SPLIT>. The goddess<SPLIT>, having done her task below<SPLIT>, Mounts up on equal wings<SPLIT>, and bends her painted bow<SPLIT>. Struck with the sight<SPLIT>, and seiz'd with rage divine<SPLIT>, The matrons prosecute their mad design<SPLIT>: They shriek aloud<SPLIT>; they snatch<SPLIT>, with impious hands<SPLIT>, The food of altars<SPLIT>; fires and flaming brands<SPLIT>. Green boughs and saplings<SPLIT>, mingled in their haste<SPLIT>, And smoking torches<SPLIT>, on the ships they cast<SPLIT>. The flame<SPLIT>, unstopp'd at first<SPLIT>, more fury gains<SPLIT>, And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins<SPLIT>: Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars<SPLIT>, And seizes<SPLIT>, in this way<SPLIT>, the banks and crackling oars<SPLIT>. Eumelus was the first the news to bear<SPLIT>, While yet they crowd the rural theater<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, what they hear<SPLIT>, is witness'd by their eyes<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>storm of sparkles and of flames arise<SPLIT>. Ascanius took th<SPLIT>' alarm<SPLIT>, while yet he led His early warriors on his prancing steed<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, spurring on<SPLIT>, his equals soon o<SPLIT>'erpass'd<SPLIT>; Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste<SPLIT>. Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view<SPLIT>, He sent his voice before him as he flew<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What madness moves you<SPLIT>, matrons<SPLIT>, to destroy The last remainders of unhappy Troy<SPLIT>! Not hostile fleets<SPLIT>, but your own hopes<SPLIT>, you burn<SPLIT>, And on your friends your fatal fury turn<SPLIT>. Behold your own Ascanius<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" While he said<SPLIT>, He drew his glitt<SPLIT>'ring helmet from his head<SPLIT>, In which the youths to sportful arms he led<SPLIT>. By this<SPLIT>, Aeneas and his train appear<SPLIT>; And now the women<SPLIT>, seiz'd with shame and fear<SPLIT>, Dispers'd<SPLIT>, to woods and caverns take their flight<SPLIT>, Abhor their actions<SPLIT>, and avoid the light<SPLIT>; Their friends acknowledge<SPLIT>, and their error find<SPLIT>, And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind<SPLIT>.
Not so the raging fires their fury cease<SPLIT>, But<SPLIT>, lurking in the seams<SPLIT>, with seeming peace<SPLIT>, Work on their way amid the smold<SPLIT>'ring tow<SPLIT>, Sure in destruction<SPLIT>, but in motion slow<SPLIT>. The silent plague thro<SPLIT>' the green timber eats<SPLIT>, And vomits out a tardy flame by fits<SPLIT>. Down to the keels<SPLIT>, and upward to the sails<SPLIT>, The fire descends<SPLIT>, or mounts<SPLIT>, but still prevails<SPLIT>; Nor buckets pour'd<SPLIT>, nor strength of human hand<SPLIT>, Can the victorious element withstand<SPLIT>.
The pious hero rends his robe<SPLIT>, and throws To heav'n his hands<SPLIT>, and with his hands his vows<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>O Jove<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he cried<SPLIT>, "if pray<SPLIT>'rs can yet have place<SPLIT>; If thou abhorr<SPLIT>'st not all the Dardan race<SPLIT>; If any spark of pity still remain<SPLIT>; If gods are gods<SPLIT>, and not invok'd in vain<SPLIT>; Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train<SPLIT>! Yet from the flames our burning vessels free<SPLIT>, Or let thy fury fall alone on me<SPLIT>! At this devoted head thy thunder throw<SPLIT>, And send the willing sacrifice below<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
Scarce had he said<SPLIT>, when southern storms arise<SPLIT>: From pole to pole the forky lightning flies<SPLIT>; Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain<SPLIT>; Heav'n bellies downward<SPLIT>, and descends in rain<SPLIT>. Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, hissing thro<SPLIT>' the planks<SPLIT>, the flames prevent<SPLIT>, And stop the fiery pest<SPLIT>. Four ships alone Burn to the waist<SPLIT>, and for the fleet atone<SPLIT>.
But doubtful thoughts the hero<SPLIT>'s heart divide<SPLIT>; If he should still in Sicily reside<SPLIT>, Forgetful of his fates<SPLIT>, or tempt the main<SPLIT>, In hope the promis'd Italy to gain<SPLIT>. Then Nautes<SPLIT>, old and wise<SPLIT>, to whom alone The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown<SPLIT>; Vers'd in portents<SPLIT>, experienc'd<SPLIT>, and inspir'd To tell events<SPLIT>, and what the fates requir'd<SPLIT>; Thus while he stood<SPLIT>, to neither part inclin'd<SPLIT>, With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O goddess-born<SPLIT>, resign'd in ev'ry state<SPLIT>, With patience bear<SPLIT>, with prudence push your fate<SPLIT>. By suff'ring well<SPLIT>, our Fortune we subdue<SPLIT>; Fly when she frowns<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, when she calls<SPLIT>, pursue<SPLIT>. Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind<SPLIT>; To him disclose the secrets of your mind<SPLIT>: Trust in his hands your old and useless train<SPLIT>; Too num<SPLIT>'rous for the ships which yet remain<SPLIT>: The feeble<SPLIT>, old<SPLIT>, indulgent of their ease<SPLIT>, The dames who dread the dangers of the seas<SPLIT>, With all the dastard crew<SPLIT>, who dare not stand The shock of battle with your foes by land<SPLIT>. Here you may build a common town for all<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, from Acestes<SPLIT>' name<SPLIT>, Acesta call<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The reasons<SPLIT>, with his friend<SPLIT>'s experience join'd<SPLIT>, Encourag'd much<SPLIT>, but more disturb'd his mind<SPLIT>.
'<SPLIT>T was dead of night<SPLIT>; when to his slumb'ring eyes His father<SPLIT>'s shade descended from the skies<SPLIT>, And thus he spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O more than vital breath<SPLIT>, Lov'd while I liv'd<SPLIT>, and dear ev'n after death<SPLIT>; O<SPLIT>son<SPLIT>, in various toils and troubles toss'd<SPLIT>, The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost On his commands<SPLIT>: the god<SPLIT>, who sav'd from fire Your flaming fleet<SPLIT>, and heard your just desire<SPLIT>. The wholesome counsel of your friend receive<SPLIT>, And here the coward train and woman leave<SPLIT>: The chosen youth<SPLIT>, and those who nobly dare<SPLIT>, Transport<SPLIT>, to tempt the dangers of the war<SPLIT>. The stern Italians will their courage try<SPLIT>; Rough are their manners<SPLIT>, and their minds are high<SPLIT>. But first to Pluto<SPLIT>'s palace you shall go<SPLIT>, And seek my shade among the blest below<SPLIT>: For not with impious ghosts my soul remains<SPLIT>, Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains<SPLIT>, But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains<SPLIT>. The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey<SPLIT>, And blood of offer'd victims free the way<SPLIT>. There shall you know what realms the gods assign<SPLIT>, And learn the fates and fortunes of your line<SPLIT>. But now<SPLIT>, farewell<SPLIT>! I vanish with the night<SPLIT>, And feel the blast of heav'n<SPLIT>'s approaching light<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and mix'd with shades<SPLIT>, and took his airy flight<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Whither so fast<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" the filial duty cried<SPLIT>; "<SPLIT>And why<SPLIT>, ah why<SPLIT>, the wish'd embrace denied<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>, and rose<SPLIT>; as holy zeal inspires<SPLIT>, He rakes hot embers<SPLIT>, and renews the fires<SPLIT>; His country gods and Vesta then adores With cakes and incense<SPLIT>, and their aid implores<SPLIT>. Next<SPLIT>, for his friends and royal host he sent<SPLIT>, Reveal'd his vision<SPLIT>, and the gods<SPLIT>' intent<SPLIT>, With his own purpose<SPLIT>. All<SPLIT>, without delay<SPLIT>, The will of Jove<SPLIT>, and his desires obey<SPLIT>. They list with women each degenerate name<SPLIT>, Who dares not hazard life for future fame<SPLIT>. These they cashier<SPLIT>: the brave remaining few<SPLIT>, Oars<SPLIT>, banks<SPLIT>, and cables<SPLIT>, half consum'd<SPLIT>, renew<SPLIT>. The prince designs a city with the plow<SPLIT>; The lots their sev'ral tenements allow<SPLIT>. This part is nam'd from Ilium<SPLIT>, that from Troy<SPLIT>, And the new king ascends the throne with joy<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>chosen senate from the people draws<SPLIT>; Appoints the judges<SPLIT>, and ordains the laws<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, on the top of Eryx<SPLIT>, they begin A<SPLIT>rising temple to the Paphian queen<SPLIT>. Anchises<SPLIT>, last<SPLIT>, is honor'd as a god<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>priest is added<SPLIT>, annual gifts bestow'd<SPLIT>, And groves are planted round his blest abode<SPLIT>. Nine days they pass in feasts<SPLIT>, their temples crown'd<SPLIT>; And fumes of incense in the fanes abound<SPLIT>. Then from the south arose a gentle breeze That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas<SPLIT>; The rising winds a ruffling gale afford<SPLIT>, And call the merry mariners aboard<SPLIT>.
Now loud laments along the shores resound<SPLIT>, Of parting friends in close embraces bound<SPLIT>. The trembling women<SPLIT>, the degenerate train<SPLIT>, Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main<SPLIT>, Ev'n those desire to sail<SPLIT>, and take their share Of the rough passage and the promis'd war<SPLIT>: Whom good Aeneas cheers<SPLIT>, and recommends To their new master<SPLIT>'s care his fearful friends<SPLIT>. On Eryx<SPLIT>'s altars three fat calves he lays<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas<SPLIT>; Then slips his haulsers<SPLIT>, and his anchors weighs<SPLIT>. High on the deck the godlike hero stands<SPLIT>, With olive crown'd<SPLIT>, a charger in his hands<SPLIT>; Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine<SPLIT>, And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine<SPLIT>. Fresh gales arise<SPLIT>; with equal strokes they vie<SPLIT>, And brush the buxom seas<SPLIT>, and o<SPLIT>'er the billows fly<SPLIT>.
Meantime the mother goddess<SPLIT>, full of fears<SPLIT>, To Neptune thus address'd<SPLIT>, with tender tears<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The pride of Jove<SPLIT>'s imperious queen<SPLIT>, the rage<SPLIT>, The malice which no suff'rings can assuage<SPLIT>, Compel me to these pray<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>; since neither fate<SPLIT>, Nor time<SPLIT>, nor pity<SPLIT>, can remove her hate<SPLIT>: Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife<SPLIT>; Still vanquish'd<SPLIT>, yet she still renews the strife<SPLIT>. As if 't were little to consume the town Which aw'd the world<SPLIT>, and wore th<SPLIT>' imperial crown<SPLIT>, She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains<SPLIT>, And gnaws<SPLIT>, ev'n to the bones<SPLIT>, the last remains<SPLIT>. Let her the causes of her hatred tell<SPLIT>; But you can witness its effects too well<SPLIT>. You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods<SPLIT>, That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds<SPLIT>; When<SPLIT>, bribing Aeolus<SPLIT>, she shook the main<SPLIT>, And mov'd rebellion in your wat<SPLIT>'ry reign<SPLIT>. With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames<SPLIT>, To burn their fleet with execrable flames<SPLIT>, And forc'd Aeneas<SPLIT>, when his ships were lost<SPLIT>, To leave his foll<SPLIT>'wers on a foreign coast<SPLIT>. For what remains<SPLIT>, your godhead I implore<SPLIT>, And trust my son to your protecting pow'r<SPLIT>. If neither Jove<SPLIT>'s nor Fate<SPLIT>'s decree withstand<SPLIT>, Secure his passage to the Latian land<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What may not Venus hope from Neptune<SPLIT>'s reign<SPLIT>? My kingdom claims your birth<SPLIT>; my late defense Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence<SPLIT>. Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care<SPLIT>. Thee<SPLIT>, Xanthus<SPLIT>, and thee<SPLIT>, Simois<SPLIT>, I attest<SPLIT>. Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd<SPLIT>, And drove before him headlong on the plain<SPLIT>, And dash'd against the walls the trembling train<SPLIT>; When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain<SPLIT>; When crimson Xanthus<SPLIT>, doubtful of his way<SPLIT>, Stood up on ridges to behold the sea<SPLIT>; (<SPLIT>New heaps came tumbling in<SPLIT>, and chok'd his way<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>) When your Aeneas fought<SPLIT>, but fought with odds Of force unequal<SPLIT>, and unequal gods<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>spread a cloud before the victor<SPLIT>'s sight<SPLIT>, Sustain'd the vanquish'd<SPLIT>, and secur'd his flight<SPLIT>; Ev'n then secur'd him<SPLIT>, when I sought with joy The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy<SPLIT>. My will<SPLIT>'s the same<SPLIT>: fair goddess<SPLIT>, fear no more<SPLIT>, Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore<SPLIT>; Their lives are giv'n<SPLIT>; one destin'd head alone Shall perish<SPLIT>, and for multitudes atone<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind<SPLIT>, His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd<SPLIT>, Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws<SPLIT>, And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws<SPLIT>. High on the waves his azure car he guides<SPLIT>; Its axles thunder<SPLIT>, and the sea subsides<SPLIT>, And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides<SPLIT>. The tempests fly before their father<SPLIT>'s face<SPLIT>, Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace<SPLIT>, And monster whales before their master play<SPLIT>, And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat<SPLIT>'ry way<SPLIT>. The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide To right and left<SPLIT>; the gods his better side Inclose<SPLIT>, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride<SPLIT>.
Now smiling hope<SPLIT>, with sweet vicissitude<SPLIT>, Within the hero<SPLIT>'s mind his joys renew'd<SPLIT>. He calls to raise the masts<SPLIT>, the sheets display<SPLIT>; The cheerful crew with diligence obey<SPLIT>; They scud before the wind<SPLIT>, and sail in open sea<SPLIT>. Ahead of all the master pilot steers<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, as he leads<SPLIT>, the following navy veers<SPLIT>. The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky<SPLIT>, The drowsy rowers on their benches lie<SPLIT>, When the soft God of Sleep<SPLIT>, with easy flight<SPLIT>, Descends<SPLIT>, and draws behind a trail of light<SPLIT>. Thou<SPLIT>, Palinurus<SPLIT>, art his destin'd prey<SPLIT>; To thee alone he takes his fatal way<SPLIT>. Dire dreams to thee<SPLIT>, and iron sleep<SPLIT>, he bears<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, lighting on thy prow<SPLIT>, the form of Phorbas wears<SPLIT>. Then thus the traitor god began his tale<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The winds<SPLIT>, my friend<SPLIT>, inspire a pleasing gale<SPLIT>; The ships<SPLIT>, without thy care<SPLIT>, securely sail<SPLIT>. Now steal an hour of sweet repose<SPLIT>; and I Will take the rudder and thy room supply<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" To whom the yawning pilot<SPLIT>, half asleep<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep<SPLIT>, The harlot smiles of her dissembling face<SPLIT>, And to her faith commit the Trojan race<SPLIT>? Shall I believe the Siren South again<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, oft betray'd<SPLIT>, not know the monster main<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, fix'd on heav'n<SPLIT>, his eyes repel invading sleep. The god was wroth<SPLIT>, and at his temples threw A<SPLIT>branch in Lethe dipp'd<SPLIT>, and drunk with Stygian dew<SPLIT>: The pilot<SPLIT>, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine<SPLIT>, Soon clos'd his swimming eyes<SPLIT>, and lay supine<SPLIT>. Scarce were his limbs extended at their length<SPLIT>, The god<SPLIT>, insulting with superior strength<SPLIT>, Fell heavy on him<SPLIT>, plung'd him in the sea<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, with the stern<SPLIT>, the rudder tore away<SPLIT>. Headlong he fell<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, struggling in the main<SPLIT>, Cried out for helping hands<SPLIT>, but cried in vain<SPLIT>. The victor daemon mounts obscure in air<SPLIT>, While the ship sails without the pilot<SPLIT>'s care<SPLIT>. On Neptune<SPLIT>'s faith the floating fleet relies<SPLIT>; But what the man forsook<SPLIT>, the god supplies<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er the dang<SPLIT>'rous deep secure the navy flies<SPLIT>; Glides by the Sirens<SPLIT>' cliffs<SPLIT>, a shelfy coast<SPLIT>, Long infamous for ships and sailors lost<SPLIT>, And white with bones<SPLIT>. Th' impetuous ocean roars<SPLIT>, And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores<SPLIT>. The watchful hero felt the knocks<SPLIT>, and found The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground<SPLIT>. Sure of his pilot<SPLIT>'s loss<SPLIT>, he takes himself The helm<SPLIT>, and steers aloof<SPLIT>, and shuns the shelf<SPLIT>. Inly he griev'd<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, groaning from the breast<SPLIT>, Deplor'd his death<SPLIT>; and thus his pain express'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>For faith repos'd on seas<SPLIT>, and on the flatt<SPLIT>'ring sky<SPLIT>, Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"

BOOK VI
He said<SPLIT>, and wept<SPLIT>; then spread his sails before The winds<SPLIT>, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore<SPLIT>: Their anchors dropp'd<SPLIT>, his crew the vessels moor<SPLIT>. They turn their heads to sea<SPLIT>, their sterns to land<SPLIT>, And greet with greedy joy th<SPLIT>' Italian strand<SPLIT>. Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed<SPLIT>; Some gather sticks<SPLIT>, the kindled flames to feed<SPLIT>, Or search for hollow trees<SPLIT>, and fell the woods<SPLIT>, Or trace thro<SPLIT>' valleys the discover'd floods<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, while their sev'ral charges they fulfil<SPLIT>, The pious prince ascends the sacred hill Where Phoebus is ador'd<SPLIT>; and seeks the shade Which hides from sight his venerable maid<SPLIT>. Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode<SPLIT>; Thence full of fate returns<SPLIT>, and of the god<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' Trivia<SPLIT>'s grove they walk<SPLIT>; and now behold<SPLIT>, And enter now<SPLIT>, the temple roof'd with gold<SPLIT>. When Daedalus<SPLIT>, to fly the Cretan shore<SPLIT>, His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>The first who sail'd in air<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) 't is sung by Fame<SPLIT>, To the Cumaean coast at length he came<SPLIT>, And here alighting<SPLIT>, built this costly frame<SPLIT>. Inscrib'd to Phoebus<SPLIT>, here he hung on high The steerage of his wings<SPLIT>, that cut the sky<SPLIT>: Then o<SPLIT>'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd Androgeos<SPLIT>' death<SPLIT>, and off'rings to his ghost<SPLIT>; Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent<SPLIT>, to meet The fate appointed by revengeful Crete<SPLIT>. And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd<SPLIT>, In which the destin'd names by lots were cast<SPLIT>: The mournful parents stand around in tears<SPLIT>, And rising Crete against their shore appears<SPLIT>. There too<SPLIT>, in living sculpture<SPLIT>, might be seen The mad affection of the Cretan queen<SPLIT>; Then how she cheats her bellowing lover<SPLIT>'s eye<SPLIT>; The rushing leap<SPLIT>, the doubtful progeny<SPLIT>, The lower part a beast<SPLIT>, a man above<SPLIT>, The monument of their polluted love<SPLIT>. Not far from thence he grav'd the wondrous maze<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>thousand doors<SPLIT>, a thousand winding ways<SPLIT>: Here dwells the monster<SPLIT>, hid from human view<SPLIT>, Not to be found<SPLIT>, but by the faithful clew<SPLIT>; Till the kind artist<SPLIT>, mov'd with pious grief<SPLIT>, Lent to the loving maid this last relief<SPLIT>, And all those erring paths describ'd so well That Theseus conquer'd and the monster fell<SPLIT>. Here hapless Icarus had found his part<SPLIT>, Had not the father<SPLIT>'s grief restrain'd his art<SPLIT>. He twice assay'd to cast his son in gold<SPLIT>; Twice from his hands he dropp'd the forming mold<SPLIT>.
All this with wond<SPLIT>'ring eyes Aeneas view'd<SPLIT>; Each varying object his delight renew'd<SPLIT>: Eager to read the rest- Achates came<SPLIT>, And by his side the mad divining dame<SPLIT>, The priestess of the god<SPLIT>, Deiphobe her name<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Time suffers not<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>to feed your eyes With empty pleasures<SPLIT>; haste the sacrifice<SPLIT>. Sev'n bullocks<SPLIT>, yet unyok'd<SPLIT>, for Phoebus choose<SPLIT>, And for Diana sev'n unspotted ewes<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This said<SPLIT>, the servants urge the sacred rites<SPLIT>, While to the temple she the prince invites<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>spacious cave<SPLIT>, within its farmost part<SPLIT>, Was hew'd and fashion'd by laborious art Thro<SPLIT>' the hill<SPLIT>'s hollow sides<SPLIT>: before the place<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>hundred doors a hundred entries grace<SPLIT>; As many voices issue<SPLIT>, and the sound Of Sybil<SPLIT>'s words as many times rebound<SPLIT>. Now to the mouth they come<SPLIT>. Aloud she cries<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>This is the time<SPLIT>; enquire your destinies<SPLIT>. He comes<SPLIT>; behold the god<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Thus while she said<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>And shiv'ring at the sacred entry stay'd<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Her color chang'd<SPLIT>; her face was not the same<SPLIT>, And hollow groans from her deep spirit came<SPLIT>. Her hair stood up<SPLIT>; convulsive rage possess'd Her trembling limbs<SPLIT>, and heav'd her lab'ring breast<SPLIT>. Greater than humankind she seem'd to look<SPLIT>, And with an accent more than mortal spoke<SPLIT>. Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll<SPLIT>; When all the god came rushing on her soul<SPLIT>.

Struggling in vain<SPLIT>, impatient of her load<SPLIT>, And lab'ring underneath the pond<SPLIT>'rous god<SPLIT>, The more she strove to shake him from her breast<SPLIT>, With more and far superior force he press'd<SPLIT>; Commands his entrance<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, without control<SPLIT>, Usurps her organs and inspires her soul<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, with a furious blast<SPLIT>, the hundred doors Ope of themselves<SPLIT>; a rushing whirlwind roars Within the cave<SPLIT>, and Sibyl<SPLIT>'s voice restores<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Escap'd the dangers of the wat<SPLIT>'ry reign<SPLIT>, Yet more and greater ills by land remain<SPLIT>.

Thus<SPLIT>, from the dark recess<SPLIT>, the Sibyl spoke<SPLIT>, And the resisting air the thunder broke<SPLIT>; The cave rebellow'd<SPLIT>, and the temple shook<SPLIT>. Th' ambiguous god<SPLIT>, who rul'd her lab'ring breast<SPLIT>, In these mysterious words his mind express'd<SPLIT>; Some truths reveal'd<SPLIT>, in terms involv'd the rest<SPLIT>. At length her fury fell<SPLIT>, her foaming ceas'd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, ebbing in her soul<SPLIT>, the god decreas'd<SPLIT>. Then thus the chief<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>No terror to my view<SPLIT>, No frightful face of danger can be new<SPLIT>. Inur'd to suffer<SPLIT>, and resolv'd to dare<SPLIT>, The Fates<SPLIT>, without my pow'r<SPLIT>, shall be without my care<SPLIT>. This let me crave<SPLIT>, since near your grove the road To hell lies open<SPLIT>, and the dark abode Which Acheron surrounds<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' innavigable flood<SPLIT>; Conduct me thro<SPLIT>' the regions void of light<SPLIT>, And lead me longing to my father<SPLIT>'s sight<SPLIT>. For him<SPLIT>, a thousand dangers I have sought<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought<SPLIT>, Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought<SPLIT>. He<SPLIT>, for my sake<SPLIT>, the raging ocean tried<SPLIT>, And wrath of Heav'n<SPLIT>, my still auspicious guide<SPLIT>, And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied<SPLIT>. Oft<SPLIT>, since he breath'd his last<SPLIT>, in dead of night His reverend image stood before my sight<SPLIT>; Enjoin'd to seek<SPLIT>, below<SPLIT>, his holy shade<SPLIT>; Conducted there by your unerring aid<SPLIT>. But you<SPLIT>, if pious minds by pray<SPLIT>'rs are won<SPLIT>, Oblige the father<SPLIT>, and protect the son<SPLIT>. Yours is the pow'r<SPLIT>; nor Proserpine in vain Has made you priestess of her nightly reign<SPLIT>. If Orpheus<SPLIT>, arm'd with his enchanting lyre<SPLIT>, The ruthless king with pity could inspire<SPLIT>, And from the shades below redeem his wife<SPLIT>; If Pollux<SPLIT>, off'ring his alternate life<SPLIT>, Could free his brother<SPLIT>, and can daily go By turns aloft<SPLIT>, by turns descend below- Why name I Theseus<SPLIT>, or his greater friend<SPLIT>, Who trod the downward path<SPLIT>, and upward could ascend<SPLIT>? Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came<SPLIT>; My mother greater<SPLIT>, my descent the same<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" So pray'd the Trojan prince<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, while he pray'd<SPLIT>, His hand upon the holy altar laid<SPLIT>.
Then thus replied the prophetess divine<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O goddess-born of great Anchises<SPLIT>' line<SPLIT>, The gates of hell are open night and day<SPLIT>; Smooth the descent<SPLIT>, and easy is the way<SPLIT>: But to return<SPLIT>, and view the cheerful skies<SPLIT>, In this the task and mighty labor lies<SPLIT>. To few great Jupiter imparts this grace<SPLIT>, And those of shining worth and heav'nly race<SPLIT>. Betwixt those regions and our upper light<SPLIT>, Deep forests and impenetrable night Possess the middle space<SPLIT>: th<SPLIT>' infernal bounds Cocytus<SPLIT>, with his sable waves<SPLIT>, surrounds<SPLIT>. But if so dire a love your soul invades<SPLIT>, As twice below to view the trembling shades<SPLIT>; If you so hard a toil will undertake<SPLIT>, As twice to pass th<SPLIT>' innavigable lake<SPLIT>; Receive my counsel<SPLIT>. In the neighb'ring grove There stands a tree<SPLIT>; the queen of Stygian Jove Claims it her own<SPLIT>; thick woods and gloomy night Conceal the happy plant from human sight<SPLIT>. One bough it bears<SPLIT>; but (<SPLIT>wondrous to behold<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>) The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold<SPLIT>: This from the vulgar branches must be torn<SPLIT>, And to fair Proserpine the present borne<SPLIT>, Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies<SPLIT>. The first thus rent a second will arise<SPLIT>, And the same metal the same room supplies<SPLIT>. Look round the wood<SPLIT>, with lifted eyes<SPLIT>, to see The lurking gold upon the fatal tree<SPLIT>: Then rend it off<SPLIT>, as holy rites command<SPLIT>; The willing metal will obey thy hand<SPLIT>, Following with ease<SPLIT>, if favor'd by thy fate<SPLIT>, Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state<SPLIT>: If not<SPLIT>, no labor can the tree constrain<SPLIT>; And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, you know not<SPLIT>, while you here attend<SPLIT>, Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend<SPLIT>: Breathless he lies<SPLIT>; and his unburied ghost<SPLIT>, Depriv'd of fun'ral rites<SPLIT>, pollutes your host<SPLIT>. Pay first his pious dues<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, for the dead<SPLIT>, Two sable sheep around his hearse be led<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, living turfs upon his body lay<SPLIT>: This done<SPLIT>, securely take the destin'd way<SPLIT>, To find the regions destitute of day<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
She said<SPLIT>, and held her peace<SPLIT>. Aeneas went Sad from the cave<SPLIT>, and full of discontent<SPLIT>, Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant<SPLIT>. Achates<SPLIT>, the companion of his breast<SPLIT>, Goes grieving by his side<SPLIT>, with equal cares oppress'd<SPLIT>. Walking<SPLIT>, they talk'd<SPLIT>, and fruitlessly divin'd What friend the priestess by those words design'd<SPLIT>. But soon they found an object to deplore<SPLIT>: Misenus lay extended on the shore<SPLIT>; Son of the God of Winds<SPLIT>: none so renown'd The warrior trumpet in the field to sound<SPLIT>; With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms<SPLIT>, And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms<SPLIT>. He serv'd great Hector<SPLIT>, and was ever near<SPLIT>, Not with his trumpet only<SPLIT>, but his spear<SPLIT>. But by Pelides<SPLIT>' arms when Hector fell<SPLIT>, He chose Aeneas<SPLIT>; and he chose as well<SPLIT>. Swoln with applause<SPLIT>, and aiming still at more<SPLIT>, He now provokes the sea gods from the shore<SPLIT>; With envy Triton heard the martial sound<SPLIT>, And the bold champion<SPLIT>, for his challenge<SPLIT>, drown'd<SPLIT>; Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand<SPLIT>: The gazing crowd around the body stand<SPLIT>. All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate<SPLIT>, And hastens to perform the funeral state<SPLIT>. In altar-wise<SPLIT>, a stately pile they rear<SPLIT>; The basis broad below<SPLIT>, and top advanc'd in air<SPLIT>. An ancient wood<SPLIT>, fit for the work design'd<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>The shady covert of the salvage kind<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) The Trojans found<SPLIT>: the sounding ax is plied<SPLIT>; Firs<SPLIT>, pines<SPLIT>, and pitch trees<SPLIT>, and the tow'ring pride Of forest ashes<SPLIT>, feel the fatal stroke<SPLIT>, And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak<SPLIT>. Huge trunks of trees<SPLIT>, fell'd from the steepy crown Of the bare mountains<SPLIT>, roll with ruin down<SPLIT>. Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears<SPLIT>, And by his pious labor urges theirs<SPLIT>.
Thus while he wrought<SPLIT>, revolving in his mind The ways to compass what his wish design'd<SPLIT>, He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove<SPLIT>, And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O may thy pow'r<SPLIT>, propitious still to me<SPLIT>, Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree<SPLIT>, In this deep forest<SPLIT>; since the Sibyl<SPLIT>'s breath Foretold<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! too true<SPLIT>, Misenus<SPLIT>' death<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Scarce had he said<SPLIT>, when<SPLIT>, full before his sight<SPLIT>, Two doves<SPLIT>, descending from their airy flight<SPLIT>, Secure upon the grassy plain alight<SPLIT>. He knew his mother<SPLIT>'s birds<SPLIT>; and thus he pray'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Be you my guides<SPLIT>, with your auspicious aid<SPLIT>, And lead my footsteps<SPLIT>, till the branch be found<SPLIT>, Whose glitt<SPLIT>'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground<SPLIT>. And thou<SPLIT>, great parent<SPLIT>, with celestial care<SPLIT>, In this distress be present to my pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Thus having said<SPLIT>, he stopp'd with watchful sight<SPLIT>, Observing still the motions of their flight<SPLIT>, What course they took<SPLIT>, what happy signs they shew<SPLIT>. They fed<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, flutt<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>, by degrees withdrew Still farther from the place<SPLIT>, but still in view<SPLIT>: Hopping and flying<SPLIT>, thus they led him on To the slow lake<SPLIT>, whose baleful stench to shun They wing'd their flight aloft<SPLIT>; then<SPLIT>, stooping low<SPLIT>, Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' the green leafs the glitt<SPLIT>'ring shadows glow<SPLIT>; As<SPLIT>, on the sacred oak<SPLIT>, the wintry mistletoe<SPLIT>, Where the proud mother views her precious brood<SPLIT>, And happier branches<SPLIT>, which she never sow'd<SPLIT>. Such was the glitt<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>; such the ruddy rind<SPLIT>, And dancing leaves<SPLIT>, that wanton'd in the wind<SPLIT>. He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold<SPLIT>, And rent away<SPLIT>, with ease<SPLIT>, the ling<SPLIT>'ring gold<SPLIT>; Then to the Sibyl<SPLIT>'s palace bore the prize<SPLIT>. Meantime the Trojan troops<SPLIT>, with weeping eyes<SPLIT>, To dead Misenus pay his obsequies<SPLIT>. First<SPLIT>, from the ground a lofty pile they rear<SPLIT>, Of pitch trees<SPLIT>, oaks<SPLIT>, and pines<SPLIT>, and unctuous fir<SPLIT>: The fabric<SPLIT>'s front with cypress twigs they strew<SPLIT>, And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew<SPLIT>. The topmost part his glitt<SPLIT>'ring arms adorn<SPLIT>; Warm waters<SPLIT>, then<SPLIT>, in brazen caldrons borne<SPLIT>, Are pour'd to wash his body<SPLIT>, joint by joint<SPLIT>, And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint<SPLIT>. With groans and cries Misenus they deplore<SPLIT>: Then on a bier<SPLIT>, with purple cover'd o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, The breathless body<SPLIT>, thus bewail'd<SPLIT>, they lay<SPLIT>, And fire the pile<SPLIT>, their faces turn'd away<SPLIT>- Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay<SPLIT>. Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw<SPLIT>, And fat of victims<SPLIT>, which his friends bestow<SPLIT>. These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour<SPLIT>; Then on the living coals red wine they pour<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, last<SPLIT>, the relics by themselves dispose<SPLIT>, Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose<SPLIT>. Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew<SPLIT>, And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew<SPLIT>; Which thrice he sprinkled round<SPLIT>, and thrice aloud Invok'd the dead<SPLIT>, and then dismissed the crowd<SPLIT>. But good Aeneas order'd on the shore A<SPLIT>stately tomb<SPLIT>, whose top a trumpet bore<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>soldier<SPLIT>'s fauchion<SPLIT>, and a seaman<SPLIT>'s oar<SPLIT>. Thus was his friend interr'd<SPLIT>; and deathless fame Still to the lofty cape consigns his name<SPLIT>. These rites perform'd<SPLIT>, the prince<SPLIT>, without delay<SPLIT>, Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way<SPLIT>. Deep was the cave<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, downward as it went From the wide mouth<SPLIT>, a rocky rough descent<SPLIT>; And here th<SPLIT>' access a gloomy grove defends<SPLIT>, And there th<SPLIT>' unnavigable lake extends<SPLIT>, O'er whose unhappy waters<SPLIT>, void of light<SPLIT>, No bird presumes to steer his airy flight<SPLIT>; Such deadly stenches from the depths arise<SPLIT>, And steaming sulphur<SPLIT>, that infects the skies<SPLIT>. From hence the Grecian bards their legends make<SPLIT>, And give the name Avernus to the lake<SPLIT>. Four sable bullocks<SPLIT>, in the yoke untaught<SPLIT>, For sacrifice the pious hero brought<SPLIT>. The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns<SPLIT>; Then cuts the curling hair<SPLIT>; that first oblation burns<SPLIT>, Invoking Hecate hither to repair<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>pow'rful name in hell and upper air<SPLIT>. The sacred priests with ready knives bereave The beasts of life<SPLIT>, and in full bowls receive The streaming blood<SPLIT>: a lamb to Hell and Night (<SPLIT>The sable wool without a streak of white<SPLIT>) Aeneas offers<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, by fate<SPLIT>'s decree<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>barren heifer<SPLIT>, Proserpine<SPLIT>, to thee<SPLIT>, With holocausts he Pluto<SPLIT>'s altar fills<SPLIT>; Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills<SPLIT>; Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours<SPLIT>; Which<SPLIT>, ointed thus<SPLIT>, the raging flame devours<SPLIT>. Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun<SPLIT>, Nor ended till the next returning sun<SPLIT>. Then earth began to bellow<SPLIT>, trees to dance<SPLIT>, And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance<SPLIT>, Ere Hecate came<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Far hence be souls profane<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" The Sibyl cried<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>and from the grove abstain<SPLIT>! Now<SPLIT>, Trojan<SPLIT>, take the way thy fates afford<SPLIT>; Assume thy courage<SPLIT>, and unsheathe thy sword<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" She said<SPLIT>, and pass'd along the gloomy space<SPLIT>; The prince pursued her steps with equal pace<SPLIT>.
Ye realms<SPLIT>, yet unreveal'd to human sight<SPLIT>, Ye gods who rule the regions of the night<SPLIT>, Ye gliding ghosts<SPLIT>, permit me to relate The mystic wonders of your silent state<SPLIT>!
Obscure they went thro<SPLIT>' dreary shades<SPLIT>, that led Along the waste dominions of the dead<SPLIT>. Thus wander travelers in woods by night<SPLIT>, By the moon<SPLIT>'s doubtful and malignant light<SPLIT>, When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies<SPLIT>, And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes<SPLIT>.
Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell<SPLIT>, Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell<SPLIT>, And pale Diseases<SPLIT>, and repining Age<SPLIT>, Want<SPLIT>, Fear<SPLIT>, and Famine<SPLIT>'s unresisted rage<SPLIT>; Here Toils<SPLIT>, and Death<SPLIT>, and Death<SPLIT>'s half-brother<SPLIT>, Sleep<SPLIT>, Forms terrible to view<SPLIT>, their sentry keep; With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind<SPLIT>, Deep Frauds before<SPLIT>, and open Force behind<SPLIT>; The Furies<SPLIT>' iron beds<SPLIT>; and Strife<SPLIT>, that shakes Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes<SPLIT>. Full in the midst of this infernal road<SPLIT>, An elm displays her dusky arms abroad<SPLIT>: The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head<SPLIT>, And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread<SPLIT>. Of various forms unnumber'd specters more<SPLIT>, Centaurs<SPLIT>, and double shapes<SPLIT>, besiege the door<SPLIT>. Before the passage<SPLIT>, horrid Hydra stands<SPLIT>, And Briareus with all his hundred hands<SPLIT>; Gorgons<SPLIT>, Geryon with his triple frame<SPLIT>; And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame<SPLIT>. The chief unsheath'd his shining steel<SPLIT>, prepar'd<SPLIT>, Tho<SPLIT>' seiz'd with sudden fear<SPLIT>, to force the guard<SPLIT>, Off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face<SPLIT>; Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace<SPLIT>, And told him what those empty phantoms were<SPLIT>: Forms without bodies<SPLIT>, and impassive air<SPLIT>. Hence to deep Acheron they take their way<SPLIT>, Whose troubled eddies<SPLIT>, thick with ooze and clay<SPLIT>, Are whirl'd aloft<SPLIT>, and in Cocytus lost<SPLIT>. There Charon stands<SPLIT>, who rules the dreary coast<SPLIT>- A<SPLIT>sordid god<SPLIT>: down from his hoary chin A<SPLIT>length of beard descends<SPLIT>, uncomb'd<SPLIT>, unclean<SPLIT>; His eyes<SPLIT>, like hollow furnaces on fire<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>girdle<SPLIT>, foul with grease<SPLIT>, binds his obscene attire<SPLIT>. He spreads his canvas<SPLIT>; with his pole he steers<SPLIT>; The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears<SPLIT>. He look'd in years<SPLIT>; yet in his years were seen A<SPLIT>youthful vigor and autumnal green<SPLIT>. An airy crowd came rushing where he stood<SPLIT>, Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood<SPLIT>: Husbands and wives<SPLIT>, boys and unmarried maids<SPLIT>, And mighty heroes<SPLIT>' more majestic shades<SPLIT>, And youths<SPLIT>, intomb'd before their fathers<SPLIT>' eyes<SPLIT>, With hollow groans<SPLIT>, and shrieks<SPLIT>, and feeble cries<SPLIT>. Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods<SPLIT>, Or fowls<SPLIT>, by winter forc'd<SPLIT>, forsake the floods<SPLIT>, And wing their hasty flight to happier lands<SPLIT>; Such<SPLIT>, and so thick<SPLIT>, the shiv'ring army stands<SPLIT>, And press for passage with extended hands<SPLIT>. Now these<SPLIT>, now those<SPLIT>, the surly boatman bore<SPLIT>: The rest he drove to distance from the shore<SPLIT>. The hero<SPLIT>, who beheld with wond<SPLIT>'ring eyes The tumult mix'd with shrieks<SPLIT>, laments<SPLIT>, and cries<SPLIT>, Ask'd of his guide<SPLIT>, what the rude concourse meant<SPLIT>; Why to the shore the thronging people bent<SPLIT>; What forms of law among the ghosts were us'd<SPLIT>; Why some were ferried o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, and some refus'd<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Son of Anchises<SPLIT>, offspring of the gods<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" The Sibyl said<SPLIT>, "you see the Stygian floods<SPLIT>, The sacred stream which heav'n<SPLIT>'s imperial state Attests in oaths<SPLIT>, and fears to violate<SPLIT>.

A<SPLIT>hundred years they wander on the shore<SPLIT>; At length<SPLIT>, their penance done<SPLIT>, are wafted o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd<SPLIT>, Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast<SPLIT>, He saw his friends<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, whelm'd beneath the waves<SPLIT>, Their fun'ral honors claim'd<SPLIT>, and ask'd their quiet graves<SPLIT>. The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew<SPLIT>, And the brave leader of the Lycian crew<SPLIT>, Whom<SPLIT>, on the Tyrrhene seas<SPLIT>, the tempests met<SPLIT>; The sailors master'd<SPLIT>, and the ship o<SPLIT>'erset<SPLIT>.
Amidst the spirits<SPLIT>, Palinurus press'd<SPLIT>, Yet fresh from life<SPLIT>, a new-admitted guest<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, while he steering view'd the stars<SPLIT>, and bore His course from Afric to the Latian shore<SPLIT>, Fell headlong down<SPLIT>. The Trojan fix'd his view<SPLIT>, And scarcely thro<SPLIT>' the gloom the sullen shadow knew<SPLIT>. Then thus the prince<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What envious pow'r<SPLIT>, O friend<SPLIT>, Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end<SPLIT>? For Phoebus<SPLIT>, ever true in all he said<SPLIT>, Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd<SPLIT>. The god foretold you should not die<SPLIT>, before You reach'd<SPLIT>, secure from seas<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' Italian shore<SPLIT>. Is this th<SPLIT>' unerring pow'r<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" The ghost replied<SPLIT>; "<SPLIT>Nor Phoebus flatter'd<SPLIT>, nor his answers lied<SPLIT>; Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep<SPLIT>: But<SPLIT>, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep<SPLIT>, My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep.

Now by the winds and raging waves I swear<SPLIT>, Your safety<SPLIT>, more than mine<SPLIT>, was then my care<SPLIT>; Lest<SPLIT>, of the guide bereft<SPLIT>, the rudder lost<SPLIT>, Your ship should run against the rocky coast<SPLIT>.

While<SPLIT>, cumber'd with my dropping clothes<SPLIT>, I lay<SPLIT>, The cruel nation<SPLIT>, covetous of prey<SPLIT>, Stain'd with my blood th<SPLIT>' unhospitable coast<SPLIT>; And now<SPLIT>, by winds and waves<SPLIT>, my lifeless limbs are toss'd<SPLIT>: Which O avert<SPLIT>, by yon ethereal light<SPLIT>, Which I have lost for this eternal night<SPLIT>! Or<SPLIT>, if by dearer ties you may be won<SPLIT>, By your dead sire<SPLIT>, and by your living son<SPLIT>, Redeem from this reproach my wand<SPLIT>'ring ghost<SPLIT>; Or with your navy seek the Velin coast<SPLIT>, And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose<SPLIT>; Or<SPLIT>, if a nearer way your mother shows<SPLIT>, Without whose aid you durst not undertake This frightful passage o<SPLIT>'er the Stygian lake<SPLIT>, Lend to this wretch your hand<SPLIT>, and waft him o<SPLIT>'er To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Scarce had he said<SPLIT>, the prophetess began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What hopes delude thee<SPLIT>, miserable man<SPLIT>? Think<SPLIT>'st thou<SPLIT>, thus unintomb'd<SPLIT>, to cross the floods<SPLIT>, To view the Furies and infernal gods<SPLIT>, And visit<SPLIT>, without leave<SPLIT>, the dark abodes<SPLIT>?

Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw<SPLIT>: Whom<SPLIT>, from the shore<SPLIT>, the surly boatman saw<SPLIT>; Observ'd their passage thro<SPLIT>' the shady wood<SPLIT>, And mark'd their near approaches to the flood<SPLIT>. Then thus he call'd aloud<SPLIT>, inflam'd with wrath<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Mortal<SPLIT>, whate<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, who this forbidden path In arms presum<SPLIT>'st to tread<SPLIT>, I charge thee<SPLIT>, stand<SPLIT>, And tell thy name<SPLIT>, and bus'ness in the land<SPLIT>.

The Trojan chief<SPLIT>, whose lineage is from Jove<SPLIT>, Much fam'd for arms<SPLIT>, and more for filial love<SPLIT>, Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove<SPLIT>. If neither piety<SPLIT>, nor Heav'n<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>, Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand<SPLIT>, This fatal present shall prevail at least<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then shew'd the shining bough<SPLIT>, conceal'd within her vest<SPLIT>. No more was needful<SPLIT>: for the gloomy god Stood mute with awe<SPLIT>, to see the golden rod<SPLIT>; Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen- A<SPLIT>venerable gift<SPLIT>, so rarely seen<SPLIT>. His fury thus appeas'd<SPLIT>, he puts to land<SPLIT>; The ghosts forsake their seats at his command<SPLIT>: He clears the deck<SPLIT>, receives the mighty freight<SPLIT>; The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight<SPLIT>. Slowly she sails<SPLIT>, and scarcely stems the tides<SPLIT>; The pressing water pours within her sides<SPLIT>.

No sooner landed<SPLIT>, in his den they found The triple porter of the Stygian sound<SPLIT>, Grim Cerberus<SPLIT>, who soon began to rear His crested snakes<SPLIT>, and arm'd his bristling hair<SPLIT>. The prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd A<SPLIT>sop<SPLIT>, in honey steep'd<SPLIT>, to charm the guard<SPLIT>; Which<SPLIT>, mix'd with pow'rful drugs<SPLIT>, she cast before His greedy grinning jaws<SPLIT>, just op'd to roar<SPLIT>.

The next<SPLIT>, in place and punishment<SPLIT>, are they Who prodigally throw their souls away<SPLIT>; Fools<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, repining at their wretched state<SPLIT>, And loathing anxious life<SPLIT>, suborn'd their fate<SPLIT>. With late repentance now they would retrieve The bodies they forsook<SPLIT>, and wish to live<SPLIT>; Their pains and poverty desire to bear<SPLIT>, To view the light of heav'n<SPLIT>, and breathe the vital air<SPLIT>: But fate forbids<SPLIT>; the Stygian floods oppose<SPLIT>, And with circling streams the captive souls inclose<SPLIT>.
Not far from thence<SPLIT>, the Mournful Fields appear So call'd from lovers that inhabit there<SPLIT>. The souls whom that unhappy flame invades<SPLIT>, In secret solitude and myrtle shades Make endless moans<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, pining with desire<SPLIT>, Lament too late their unextinguish'd fire<SPLIT>. Here Procris<SPLIT>, Eriphyle here he found<SPLIT>, Baring her breast<SPLIT>, yet bleeding with the wound Made by her son<SPLIT>. He saw Pasiphae there<SPLIT>, With Phaedra<SPLIT>'s ghost<SPLIT>, a foul incestuous pair<SPLIT>. There Laodamia<SPLIT>, with Evadne<SPLIT>, moves<SPLIT>, Unhappy both<SPLIT>, but loyal in their loves<SPLIT>: Caeneus<SPLIT>, a woman once<SPLIT>, and once a man<SPLIT>, But ending in the sex she first began<SPLIT>. Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood<SPLIT>, Fresh from her wound<SPLIT>, her bosom bath'd in blood<SPLIT>; Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew<SPLIT>, Obscure in shades<SPLIT>, and with a doubtful view<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Doubtful as he who sees<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' dusky night<SPLIT>, Or thinks he sees<SPLIT>, the moon<SPLIT>'s uncertain light<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, as his love inspir'd him<SPLIT>, thus he said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Unhappy queen<SPLIT>! then is the common breath Of rumor true<SPLIT>, in your reported death<SPLIT>, And I<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! the cause<SPLIT>? By Heav'n<SPLIT>, I vow<SPLIT>, And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below<SPLIT>, Unwilling I forsook your friendly state<SPLIT>, Commanded by the gods<SPLIT>, and forc'd by fate- Those gods<SPLIT>, that fate<SPLIT>, whose unresisted might Have sent me to these regions void of light<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' the vast empire of eternal night<SPLIT>. Nor dar'd I to presume<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, press'd with grief<SPLIT>, My flight should urge you to this dire relief<SPLIT>. Stay<SPLIT>, stay your steps<SPLIT>, and listen to my vows<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>T is the last interview that fate allows<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" In vain he thus attempts her mind to move With tears<SPLIT>, and pray<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, and late-repenting love<SPLIT>. Disdainfully she look'd<SPLIT>; then turning round<SPLIT>, But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground<SPLIT>, And what he says and swears<SPLIT>, regards no more Than the deaf rocks<SPLIT>, when the loud billows roar<SPLIT>; But whirl'd away<SPLIT>, to shun his hateful sight<SPLIT>, Hid in the forest and the shades of night<SPLIT>; Then sought Sichaeus thro<SPLIT>' the shady grove<SPLIT>, Who answer'd all her cares<SPLIT>, and equal'd all her love<SPLIT>.
Some pious tears the pitying hero paid<SPLIT>, And follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade<SPLIT>, Then took the forward way<SPLIT>, by fate ordain'd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, with his guide<SPLIT>, the farther fields attain'd<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>, sever'd from the rest<SPLIT>, the warrior souls remain'd<SPLIT>. Tydeus he met<SPLIT>, with Meleager<SPLIT>'s race<SPLIT>, The pride of armies<SPLIT>, and the soldiers<SPLIT>' grace<SPLIT>; And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face<SPLIT>. Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num<SPLIT>'rous train<SPLIT>, All much lamented<SPLIT>, all in battle slain<SPLIT>; Glaucus and Medon<SPLIT>, high above the rest<SPLIT>, Antenor<SPLIT>'s sons<SPLIT>, and Ceres<SPLIT>' sacred priest<SPLIT>. And proud Idaeus<SPLIT>, Priam<SPLIT>'s charioteer<SPLIT>, Who shakes his empty reins<SPLIT>, and aims his airy spear<SPLIT>. The gladsome ghosts<SPLIT>, in circling troops<SPLIT>, attend And with unwearied eyes behold their friend<SPLIT>; Delight to hover near<SPLIT>, and long to know What bus'ness brought him to the realms below<SPLIT>. But Argive chiefs<SPLIT>, and Agamemnon<SPLIT>'s train<SPLIT>, When his refulgent arms flash'd thro<SPLIT>' the shady plain<SPLIT>, Fled from his well-known face<SPLIT>, with wonted fear<SPLIT>, As when his thund<SPLIT>'ring sword and pointed spear Drove headlong to their ships<SPLIT>, and glean'd the routed rear<SPLIT>. They rais'd a feeble cry<SPLIT>, with trembling notes<SPLIT>; But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats<SPLIT>.
Here Priam<SPLIT>'s son<SPLIT>, Deiphobus<SPLIT>, he found<SPLIT>, Whose face and limbs were one continued wound<SPLIT>: Dishonest<SPLIT>, with lopp'd arms<SPLIT>, the youth appears<SPLIT>, Spoil'd of his nose<SPLIT>, and shorten'd of his ears<SPLIT>. He scarcely knew him<SPLIT>, striving to disown His blotted form<SPLIT>, and blushing to be known<SPLIT>; And therefore first began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O Teucer<SPLIT>'s race<SPLIT>, Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface<SPLIT>? What heart could wish<SPLIT>, what hand inflict<SPLIT>, this dire disgrace<SPLIT>? '<SPLIT>Twas fam'd<SPLIT>, that in our last and fatal night Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight<SPLIT>, Till tir'd<SPLIT>, not forc'd<SPLIT>, a glorious fate you chose<SPLIT>, And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, in remembrance of so brave a deed<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed<SPLIT>; Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains<SPLIT>: The place your armor and your name retains<SPLIT>. Your body too I sought<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, had I found<SPLIT>, Design'd for burial in your native ground<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
The ghost replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Your piety has paid All needful rites<SPLIT>, to rest my wand<SPLIT>'ring shade<SPLIT>; But cruel fate<SPLIT>, and my more cruel wife<SPLIT>, To Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life<SPLIT>. These are the monuments of Helen<SPLIT>'s love<SPLIT>: The shame I bear below<SPLIT>, the marks I bore above<SPLIT>. You know in what deluding joys we pass'd The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last<SPLIT>: For<SPLIT>, when the fatal horse<SPLIT>, descending down<SPLIT>, Pregnant with arms<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'erwhelm'd th<SPLIT>' unhappy town She feign'd nocturnal orgies<SPLIT>; left my bed<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, mix'd with Trojan dames<SPLIT>, the dances led Then<SPLIT>, waving high her torch<SPLIT>, the signal made<SPLIT>, Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade<SPLIT>. With watching overworn<SPLIT>, with cares oppress'd<SPLIT>, Unhappy I had laid me down to rest<SPLIT>, And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd<SPLIT>. Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid<SPLIT>, And from beneath my head my sword convey'd<SPLIT>; The door unlatch'd<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, with repeated calls<SPLIT>, Invites her former lord within my walls<SPLIT>. Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd<SPLIT>, And with new treasons would redeem the past<SPLIT>. What need I more<SPLIT>? Into the room they ran<SPLIT>, And meanly murther'd a defenseless man<SPLIT>. Ulysses<SPLIT>, basely born<SPLIT>, first led the way<SPLIT>. Avenging pow'rs<SPLIT>! with justice if I pray<SPLIT>, That fortune be their own another day<SPLIT>! But answer you<SPLIT>; and in your turn relate<SPLIT>, What brought you<SPLIT>, living<SPLIT>, to the Stygian state<SPLIT>: Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea<SPLIT>, Or did you Heav'n<SPLIT>'s superior doom obey<SPLIT>? Or tell what other chance conducts your way<SPLIT>, To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats<SPLIT>, Tumults and torments of th<SPLIT>' infernal seats<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
While thus in talk the flying hours they pass<SPLIT>, The sun had finish'd more than half his race<SPLIT>: And they<SPLIT>, perhaps<SPLIT>, in words and tears had spent The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent<SPLIT>; But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Night rushes down<SPLIT>, and headlong drives the day<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>T is here<SPLIT>, in different paths<SPLIT>, the way divides<SPLIT>; The right to Pluto<SPLIT>'s golden palace guides<SPLIT>; The left to that unhappy region tends<SPLIT>, Which to the depth of Tartarus descends<SPLIT>; The seat of night profound<SPLIT>, and punish'd fiends<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then thus Deiphobus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O sacred maid<SPLIT>, Forbear to chide<SPLIT>, and be your will obey'd<SPLIT>! Lo! to the secret shadows I retire<SPLIT>, To pay my penance till my years expire<SPLIT>. Proceed<SPLIT>, auspicious prince<SPLIT>, with glory crown'd<SPLIT>, And born to better fates than I have found<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, while he said<SPLIT>, his steps he turn'd To secret shadows<SPLIT>, and in silence mourn'd<SPLIT>.
The hero<SPLIT>, looking on the left<SPLIT>, espied A<SPLIT>lofty tow'r<SPLIT>, and strong on ev'ry side With treble walls<SPLIT>, which Phlegethon surrounds<SPLIT>, Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, press'd betwixt the rocks<SPLIT>, the bellowing noise resounds Wide is the fronting gate<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, rais'd on high With adamantine columns<SPLIT>, threats the sky<SPLIT>. Vain is the force of man<SPLIT>, and Heav'n<SPLIT>'s as vain<SPLIT>, To crush the pillars which the pile sustain<SPLIT>. Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd<SPLIT>; And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward<SPLIT>, Girt in her sanguine gown<SPLIT>, by night and day<SPLIT>, Observant of the souls that pass the downward way<SPLIT>. From hence are heard the groans of ghosts<SPLIT>, the pains Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains<SPLIT>. The Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries<SPLIT>, And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise<SPLIT>; And what the crimes<SPLIT>, and what the tortures were<SPLIT>, And loud laments that rent the liquid air<SPLIT>.
She thus replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The chaste and holy race Are all forbidden this polluted place<SPLIT>. But Hecate<SPLIT>, when she gave to rule the woods<SPLIT>, Then led me trembling thro<SPLIT>' these dire abodes<SPLIT>, And taught the tortures of th<SPLIT>' avenging gods<SPLIT>. These are the realms of unrelenting fate<SPLIT>; And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state<SPLIT>. He hears and judges each committed crime<SPLIT>; Enquires into the manner<SPLIT>, place<SPLIT>, and time<SPLIT>. The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Loth to confess<SPLIT>, unable to conceal<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, From the first moment of his vital breath<SPLIT>, To his last hour of unrepenting death<SPLIT>.

Then<SPLIT>, of itself<SPLIT>, unfolds th<SPLIT>' eternal door<SPLIT>; With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar<SPLIT>. You see<SPLIT>, before the gate<SPLIT>, what stalking ghost Commands the guard<SPLIT>, what sentries keep the post<SPLIT>. More formidable Hydra stands within<SPLIT>, Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin<SPLIT>. The gaping gulf low to the center lies<SPLIT>, And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies<SPLIT>. The rivals of the gods<SPLIT>, the Titan race<SPLIT>, Here<SPLIT>, sing'd with lightning<SPLIT>, roll within th<SPLIT>' unfathom'd space<SPLIT>. Here lie th<SPLIT>' Alaean twins<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>I saw them both<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Enormous bodies<SPLIT>, of gigantic growth<SPLIT>, Who dar'd in fight the Thund<SPLIT>'rer to defy<SPLIT>, Affect his heav'n<SPLIT>, and force him from the sky<SPLIT>. Salmoneus<SPLIT>, suff'ring cruel pains<SPLIT>, I found<SPLIT>, For emulating Jove<SPLIT>; the rattling sound Of mimic thunder<SPLIT>, and the glitt<SPLIT>'ring blaze Of pointed lightnings<SPLIT>, and their forky rays<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew<SPLIT>; Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew<SPLIT>: He wav'd a torch aloft<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, madly vain<SPLIT>, Sought godlike worship from a servile train<SPLIT>. Ambitious fool<SPLIT>! with horny hoofs to pass O'er hollow arches of resounding brass<SPLIT>, To rival thunder in its rapid course<SPLIT>, And imitate inimitable force<SPLIT>! But he<SPLIT>, the King of Heav'n<SPLIT>, obscure on high<SPLIT>, Bar'd his red arm<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, launching from the sky His writhen bolt<SPLIT>, not shaking empty smoke<SPLIT>, Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook<SPLIT>. There Tityus was to see<SPLIT>, who took his birth From heav'n<SPLIT>, his nursing from the foodful earth<SPLIT>. Here his gigantic limbs<SPLIT>, with large embrace<SPLIT>, Infold nine acres of infernal space<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>rav'nous vulture<SPLIT>, in his open'd side<SPLIT>, Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried<SPLIT>; Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast<SPLIT>; The growing liver still supplied the feast<SPLIT>; Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains<SPLIT>: Th' immortal hunger lasts<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' immortal food remains<SPLIT>. Ixion and Perithous I could name<SPLIT>, And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame<SPLIT>. High o<SPLIT>'er their heads a mold<SPLIT>'ring rock is plac'd<SPLIT>, That promises a fall<SPLIT>, and shakes at ev'ry blast<SPLIT>. They lie below<SPLIT>, on golden beds display'd<SPLIT>; And genial feasts with regal pomp are made<SPLIT>. The Queen of Furies by their sides is set<SPLIT>, And snatches from their mouths th<SPLIT>' untasted meat<SPLIT>, Which if they touch<SPLIT>, her hissing snakes she rears<SPLIT>, Tossing her torch<SPLIT>, and thund<SPLIT>'ring in their ears<SPLIT>. Then they<SPLIT>, who brothers<SPLIT>' better claim disown<SPLIT>, Expel their parents<SPLIT>, and usurp the throne<SPLIT>; Defraud their clients<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, to lucre sold<SPLIT>, Sit brooding on unprofitable gold<SPLIT>; Who dare not give<SPLIT>, and ev'n refuse to lend To their poor kindred<SPLIT>, or a wanting friend<SPLIT>. Vast is the throng of these<SPLIT>; nor less the train Of lustful youths<SPLIT>, for foul adult<SPLIT>'ry slain<SPLIT>: Hosts of deserters<SPLIT>, who their honor sold<SPLIT>, And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold<SPLIT>. All these within the dungeon<SPLIT>'s depth remain<SPLIT>, Despairing pardon<SPLIT>, and expecting pain<SPLIT>. Ask not what pains<SPLIT>; nor farther seek to know Their process<SPLIT>, or the forms of law below<SPLIT>. Some roll a weighty stone<SPLIT>; some<SPLIT>, laid along<SPLIT>, And bound with burning wires<SPLIT>, on spokes of wheels are hung Unhappy Theseus<SPLIT>, doom'd for ever there<SPLIT>, Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair<SPLIT>; And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries (<SPLIT>Could warning make the world more just or wise<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Learn righteousness<SPLIT>, and dread th<SPLIT>' avenging deities<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' To tyrants others have their country sold<SPLIT>, Imposing foreign lords<SPLIT>, for foreign gold<SPLIT>; Some have old laws repeal'd<SPLIT>, new statutes made<SPLIT>, Not as the people pleas'd<SPLIT>, but as they paid<SPLIT>; With incest some their daughters<SPLIT>' bed profan'd<SPLIT>: All dar'd the worst of ills<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, what they dar'd<SPLIT>, attain'd<SPLIT>. Had I a hundred mouths<SPLIT>, a hundred tongues<SPLIT>, And throats of brass<SPLIT>, inspir'd with iron lungs<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>could not half those horrid crimes repeat<SPLIT>, Nor half the punishments those crimes have met<SPLIT>.

She said<SPLIT>: and thro<SPLIT>' the gloomy shades they pass'd<SPLIT>, And chose the middle path<SPLIT>. Arriv'd at last<SPLIT>, The prince with living water sprinkled o<SPLIT>'er His limbs and body<SPLIT>; then approach'd the door<SPLIT>, Possess'd the porch<SPLIT>, and on the front above He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto<SPLIT>'s love<SPLIT>. These holy rites perform'd<SPLIT>, they took their way Where long extended plains of pleasure lay<SPLIT>: The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie<SPLIT>, With ether vested<SPLIT>, and a purple sky<SPLIT>; The blissful seats of happy souls below<SPLIT>. Stars of their own<SPLIT>, and their own suns<SPLIT>, they know<SPLIT>; Their airy limbs in sports they exercise<SPLIT>, And on the green contend the wrestler<SPLIT>'s prize<SPLIT>. Some in heroic verse divinely sing<SPLIT>; Others in artful measures led the ring<SPLIT>. The Thracian bard<SPLIT>, surrounded by the rest<SPLIT>, There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest<SPLIT>; His flying fingers<SPLIT>, and harmonious quill<SPLIT>, Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes<SPLIT>, and sev'n at once they fill<SPLIT>. Here found they Teucer<SPLIT>'s old heroic race<SPLIT>, Born better times and happier years to grace<SPLIT>. Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy Perpetual fame<SPLIT>, with him who founded Troy<SPLIT>. The chief beheld their chariots from afar<SPLIT>, Their shining arms<SPLIT>, and coursers train'd to war<SPLIT>: Their lances fix'd in earth<SPLIT>, their steeds around<SPLIT>, Free from their harness<SPLIT>, graze the flow<SPLIT>'ry ground<SPLIT>. The love of horses which they had<SPLIT>, alive<SPLIT>, And care of chariots<SPLIT>, after death survive<SPLIT>. Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain<SPLIT>; Some did the song<SPLIT>, and some the choir maintain<SPLIT>, Beneath a laurel shade<SPLIT>, where mighty Po Mounts up to woods above<SPLIT>, and hides his head below<SPLIT>. Here patriots live<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, for their country<SPLIT>'s good<SPLIT>, In fighting fields<SPLIT>, were prodigal of blood<SPLIT>: Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode<SPLIT>, And poets worthy their inspiring god<SPLIT>; And searching wits<SPLIT>, of more mechanic parts<SPLIT>, Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts<SPLIT>: Those who to worth their bounty did extend<SPLIT>, And those who knew that bounty to commend<SPLIT>. The heads of these with holy fillets bound<SPLIT>, And all their temples were with garlands crown'd<SPLIT>.
To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd<SPLIT>, And first to him surrounded by the rest (<SPLIT>Tow'ring his height<SPLIT>, and ample was his breast<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Say<SPLIT>, happy souls<SPLIT>, divine Musaeus<SPLIT>, say<SPLIT>, Where lives Anchises<SPLIT>, and where lies our way To find the hero<SPLIT>, for whose only sake We sought the dark abodes<SPLIT>, and cross'd the bitter lake<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" To this the sacred poet thus replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>In no fix'd place the happy souls reside<SPLIT>. In groves we live<SPLIT>, and lie on mossy beds<SPLIT>, By crystal streams<SPLIT>, that murmur thro<SPLIT>' the meads<SPLIT>: But pass yon easy hill<SPLIT>, and thence descend<SPLIT>; The path conducts you to your journey<SPLIT>'s end<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This said<SPLIT>, he led them up the mountain<SPLIT>'s brow<SPLIT>, And shews them all the shining fields below<SPLIT>. They wind the hill<SPLIT>, and thro<SPLIT>' the blissful meadows go<SPLIT>.
But old Anchises<SPLIT>, in a flow<SPLIT>'ry vale<SPLIT>, Review'd his muster'd race<SPLIT>, and took the tale<SPLIT>: Those happy spirits<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, ordain'd by fate<SPLIT>, For future beings and new bodies wait- With studious thought observ'd th<SPLIT>' illustrious throng<SPLIT>, In nature<SPLIT>'s order as they pass'd along<SPLIT>: Their names<SPLIT>, their fates<SPLIT>, their conduct<SPLIT>, and their care<SPLIT>, In peaceful senates and successful war<SPLIT>. He<SPLIT>, when Aeneas on the plain appears<SPLIT>, Meets him with open arms<SPLIT>, and falling tears<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Welcome<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>the gods<SPLIT>' undoubted race<SPLIT>! O<SPLIT>long expected to my dear embrace<SPLIT>! Once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face<SPLIT>! The love and pious duty which you pay Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is true<SPLIT>, computing times<SPLIT>, I now believ'd The happy day approach'd<SPLIT>; nor are my hopes deceiv'd<SPLIT>. What length of lands<SPLIT>, what oceans have you pass'd<SPLIT>; What storms sustain'd<SPLIT>, and on what shores been cast<SPLIT>? How have I fear'd your fate<SPLIT>! but fear'd it most<SPLIT>, When love assail'd you<SPLIT>, on the Libyan coast<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" To this<SPLIT>, the filial duty thus replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes Appear'd<SPLIT>, and often urg'd this painful enterprise<SPLIT>. After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea<SPLIT>, My navy rides at anchor in the bay<SPLIT>. But reach your hand<SPLIT>, O parent shade<SPLIT>, nor shun The dear embraces of your longing son<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and falling tears his face bedew<SPLIT>: Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw<SPLIT>; And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away<SPLIT>, Like winds<SPLIT>, or empty dreams that fly the day<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, in a secret vale<SPLIT>, the Trojan sees A<SPLIT>sep'rate grove<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' which a gentle breeze Plays with a passing breath<SPLIT>, and whispers thro<SPLIT>' the trees<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, just before the confines of the wood<SPLIT>, The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood<SPLIT>. About the boughs an airy nation flew<SPLIT>, Thick as the humming bees<SPLIT>, that hunt the golden dew<SPLIT>; In summer<SPLIT>'s heat on tops of lilies feed<SPLIT>, And creep within their bells<SPLIT>, to suck the balmy seed<SPLIT>: The winged army roams the fields around<SPLIT>; The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound<SPLIT>. Aeneas wond<SPLIT>'ring stood<SPLIT>, then ask'd the cause Which to the stream the crowding people draws<SPLIT>. Then thus the sire<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The souls that throng the flood Are those to whom<SPLIT>, by fate<SPLIT>, are other bodies ow'd<SPLIT>: In Lethe<SPLIT>'s lake they long oblivion taste<SPLIT>, Of future life secure<SPLIT>, forgetful of the past<SPLIT>.

Anchises then<SPLIT>, in order<SPLIT>, thus begun To clear those wonders to his godlike son<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Know<SPLIT>, first<SPLIT>, that heav'n<SPLIT>, and earth<SPLIT>'s compacted frame<SPLIT>, And flowing waters<SPLIT>, and the starry flame<SPLIT>, And both the radiant lights<SPLIT>, one common soul Inspires and feeds<SPLIT>, and animates the whole<SPLIT>. This active mind<SPLIT>, infus'd thro<SPLIT>' all the space<SPLIT>, Unites and mingles with the mighty mass<SPLIT>. Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain<SPLIT>, And birds of air<SPLIT>, and monsters of the main<SPLIT>. Th' ethereal vigor is in all the same<SPLIT>, And every soul is fill'd with equal flame<SPLIT>; As much as earthy limbs<SPLIT>, and gross allay Of mortal members<SPLIT>, subject to decay<SPLIT>, Blunt not the beams of heav'n and edge of day<SPLIT>. From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts<SPLIT>, Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts<SPLIT>, And grief<SPLIT>, and joy<SPLIT>; nor can the groveling mind<SPLIT>, In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin'd<SPLIT>, Assert the native skies<SPLIT>, or own its heav'nly kind<SPLIT>: Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains<SPLIT>; But long-contracted filth ev'n in the soul remains<SPLIT>. The relics of inveterate vice they wear<SPLIT>, And spots of sin obscene in ev'ry face appear<SPLIT>. For this are various penances enjoin'd<SPLIT>; And some are hung to bleach upon the wind<SPLIT>, Some plung'd in waters<SPLIT>, others purg'd in fires<SPLIT>, Till all the dregs are drain'd<SPLIT>, and all the rust expires<SPLIT>. All have their manes<SPLIT>, and those manes bear<SPLIT>: The few<SPLIT>, so cleans'd<SPLIT>, to these abodes repair<SPLIT>, And breathe<SPLIT>, in ample fields<SPLIT>, the soft Elysian air<SPLIT>. Then are they happy<SPLIT>, when by length of time The scurf is worn away of each committed crime<SPLIT>; No speck is left of their habitual stains<SPLIT>, But the pure ether of the soul remains<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, when a thousand rolling years are past<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>So long their punishments and penance last<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Whole droves of minds are<SPLIT>, by the driving god<SPLIT>, Compell'd to drink the deep Lethaean flood<SPLIT>, In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares Of their past labors<SPLIT>, and their irksome years<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, unrememb'ring of its former pain<SPLIT>, The soul may suffer mortal flesh again<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus having said<SPLIT>, the father spirit leads The priestess and his son thro<SPLIT>' swarms of shades<SPLIT>, And takes a rising ground<SPLIT>, from thence to see The long procession of his progeny<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Survey<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" pursued the sire<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>this airy throng<SPLIT>, As<SPLIT>, offer'd to thy view<SPLIT>, they pass along<SPLIT>.

He paus'd<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, while with wond<SPLIT>'ring eyes they view'd The passing spirits<SPLIT>, thus his speech renew'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>See great Marcellus<SPLIT>! how<SPLIT>, untir'd in toils<SPLIT>, He moves with manly grace<SPLIT>, how rich with regal spoils<SPLIT>!

BOOK VII
And thou<SPLIT>, O matron of immortal fame<SPLIT>, Here dying<SPLIT>, to the shore hast left thy name<SPLIT>; Cajeta still the place is call'd from thee<SPLIT>, The nurse of great Aeneas<SPLIT>' infancy<SPLIT>. Here rest thy bones in rich Hesperia<SPLIT>'s plains<SPLIT>; Thy name (<SPLIT>'t is all a ghost can have<SPLIT>) remains<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, when the prince her fun'ral rites had paid<SPLIT>, He plow'd the Tyrrhene seas with sails display'd<SPLIT>. From land a gentle breeze arose by night<SPLIT>, Serenely shone the stars<SPLIT>, the moon was bright<SPLIT>, And the sea trembled with her silver light<SPLIT>. Now near the shelves of Circe<SPLIT>'s shores they run<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Circe the rich<SPLIT>, the daughter of the Sun<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) A<SPLIT>dang<SPLIT>'rous coast<SPLIT>: the goddess wastes her days In joyous songs<SPLIT>; the rocks resound her lays<SPLIT>: In spinning<SPLIT>, or the loom<SPLIT>, she spends the night<SPLIT>, And cedar brands supply her father<SPLIT>'s light<SPLIT>. From hence were heard<SPLIT>, rebellowing to the main<SPLIT>, The roars of lions that refuse the chain<SPLIT>, The grunts of bristled boars<SPLIT>, and groans of bears<SPLIT>, And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors<SPLIT>' ears<SPLIT>. These from their caverns<SPLIT>, at the close of night<SPLIT>, Fill the sad isle with horror and affright<SPLIT>. Darkling they mourn their fate<SPLIT>, whom Circe<SPLIT>'s pow'r<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>That watch'd the moon and planetary hour<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) With words and wicked herbs from humankind Had alter'd<SPLIT>, and in brutal shapes confin'd<SPLIT>. Which monsters lest the Trojans<SPLIT>' pious host Should bear<SPLIT>, or touch upon th<SPLIT>' inchanted coast<SPLIT>, Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night With rising gales that sped their happy flight<SPLIT>. Supplied with these<SPLIT>, they skim the sounding shore<SPLIT>, And hear the swelling surges vainly roar<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, when the rosy morn began to rise<SPLIT>, And wav'd her saffron streamer thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>; When Thetis blush'd in purple not her own<SPLIT>, And from her face the breathing winds were blown<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>sudden silence sate upon the sea<SPLIT>, And sweeping oars<SPLIT>, with struggling<SPLIT>, urge their way<SPLIT>. The Trojan<SPLIT>, from the main<SPLIT>, beheld a wood<SPLIT>, Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood<SPLIT>: Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course<SPLIT>, With whirlpools dimpled<SPLIT>; and with downward force<SPLIT>, That drove the sand along<SPLIT>, he took his way<SPLIT>, And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea<SPLIT>. About him<SPLIT>, and above<SPLIT>, and round the wood<SPLIT>, The birds that haunt the borders of his flood<SPLIT>, That bath'd within<SPLIT>, or basked upon his side<SPLIT>, To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied<SPLIT>. The captain gives command<SPLIT>; the joyful train Glide thro<SPLIT>' the gloomy shade<SPLIT>, and leave the main<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, Erato<SPLIT>, thy poet<SPLIT>'s mind inspire<SPLIT>, And fill his soul with thy celestial fire<SPLIT>! Relate what Latium was<SPLIT>; her ancient kings<SPLIT>; Declare the past and state of things<SPLIT>, When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought<SPLIT>, And how the rivals lov'd<SPLIT>, and how they fought<SPLIT>. These are my theme<SPLIT>, and how the war began<SPLIT>, And how concluded by the godlike man<SPLIT>: For I shall sing of battles<SPLIT>, blood<SPLIT>, and rage<SPLIT>, Which princes and their people did engage<SPLIT>; And haughty souls<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, mov'd with mutual hate<SPLIT>, In fighting fields pursued and found their fate<SPLIT>; That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms<SPLIT>, And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>larger scene of action is display'd<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, rising hence<SPLIT>, a greater work is weigh'd<SPLIT>.
Latinus<SPLIT>, old and mild<SPLIT>, had long possess'd The Latin scepter<SPLIT>, and his people blest<SPLIT>: His father Faunus<SPLIT>; a Laurentian dame His mother<SPLIT>; fair Marica was her name<SPLIT>. But Faunus came from Picus<SPLIT>: Picus drew His birth from Saturn<SPLIT>, if records be true<SPLIT>. Thus King Latinus<SPLIT>, in the third degree<SPLIT>, Had Saturn author of his family<SPLIT>. But this old peaceful prince<SPLIT>, as Heav'n decreed<SPLIT>, Was blest with no male issue to succeed<SPLIT>: His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate<SPLIT>; One only daughter heir'd the royal state<SPLIT>. Fir'd with her love<SPLIT>, and with ambition led<SPLIT>, The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed<SPLIT>. Among the crowd<SPLIT>, but far above the rest<SPLIT>, Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd<SPLIT>. Turnus<SPLIT>, for high descent and graceful mien<SPLIT>, Was first<SPLIT>, and favor'd by the Latian queen<SPLIT>; With him she strove to join Lavinia<SPLIT>'s hand<SPLIT>, But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand<SPLIT>.
Deep in the palace<SPLIT>, of long growth<SPLIT>, there stood A<SPLIT>laurel<SPLIT>'s trunk<SPLIT>, a venerable wood<SPLIT>; Where rites divine were paid<SPLIT>; whose holy hair Was kept and cut with superstitious care<SPLIT>. This plant Latinus<SPLIT>, when his town he wall'd<SPLIT>, Then found<SPLIT>, and from the tree Laurentum call'd<SPLIT>; And last<SPLIT>, in honor of his new abode<SPLIT>, He vow'd the laurel to the laurel<SPLIT>'s god<SPLIT>. It happen'd once (<SPLIT>a boding prodigy<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>) A<SPLIT>swarm of bees<SPLIT>, that cut the liquid sky<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Unknown from whence they took their airy flight<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight<SPLIT>; There with their clasping feet together clung<SPLIT>, And a long cluster from the laurel hung<SPLIT>. An ancient augur prophesied from hence<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince<SPLIT>! From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands<SPLIT>, To the same parts on earth<SPLIT>; his army lands<SPLIT>; The town he conquers<SPLIT>, and the tow'r commands<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Yet more<SPLIT>, when fair Lavinia fed the fire Before the gods<SPLIT>, and stood beside her sire<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Strange to relate<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>) the flames<SPLIT>, involv'd in smoke Of incense<SPLIT>, from the sacred altar broke<SPLIT>, Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire<SPLIT>; Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire<SPLIT>: From thence the fuming trail began to spread And lambent glories danc'd about her head<SPLIT>. This new portent the seer with wonder views<SPLIT>, Then pausing<SPLIT>, thus his prophecy renews<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The nymph<SPLIT>, who scatters flaming fires around<SPLIT>, Shall shine with honor<SPLIT>, shall herself be crown'd<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, caus'd by her irrevocable fate<SPLIT>, War shall the country waste<SPLIT>, and change the state<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Latinus<SPLIT>, frighted with this dire ostent<SPLIT>, For counsel to his father Faunus went<SPLIT>, And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy Which near Albunea<SPLIT>'s sulph'rous fountain lie<SPLIT>. To these the Latian and the Sabine land Fly<SPLIT>, when distress'd<SPLIT>, and thence relief demand<SPLIT>. The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease<SPLIT>, And nightly visions in his slumber sees<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>swarm of thin aerial shapes appears<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, flutt<SPLIT>'ring round his temples<SPLIT>, deafs his ears<SPLIT>: These he consults<SPLIT>, the future fates to know<SPLIT>, From pow'rs above<SPLIT>, and from the fiends below<SPLIT>. Here<SPLIT>, for the gods<SPLIT>' advice<SPLIT>, Latinus flies<SPLIT>, Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice<SPLIT>: Their woolly fleeces<SPLIT>, as the rites requir'd<SPLIT>, He laid beneath him<SPLIT>, and to rest retir'd<SPLIT>. No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound<SPLIT>, When<SPLIT>, from above<SPLIT>, a more than mortal sound Invades his ears<SPLIT>; and thus the vision spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Seek not<SPLIT>, my seed<SPLIT>, in Latian bands to yoke Our fair Lavinia<SPLIT>, nor the gods provoke<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>foreign son upon thy shore descends<SPLIT>, Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends<SPLIT>. His race<SPLIT>, in arms and arts of peace renown'd<SPLIT>, Not Latium shall contain<SPLIT>, nor Europe bound<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>T is theirs whate<SPLIT>'er the sun surveys around<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" These answers<SPLIT>, in the silent night receiv'd<SPLIT>, The king himself divulg'd<SPLIT>, the land believ'd<SPLIT>: The fame thro<SPLIT>' all the neighb'ring nations flew<SPLIT>, When now the Trojan navy was in view<SPLIT>.
Beneath a shady tree<SPLIT>, the hero spread His table on the turf<SPLIT>, with cakes of bread<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, with his chiefs<SPLIT>, on forest fruits he fed<SPLIT>. They sate<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>not without the god<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Their homely fare dispatch'd<SPLIT>, the hungry band Invade their trenchers next<SPLIT>, and soon devour<SPLIT>, To mend the scanty meal<SPLIT>, their cakes of flour<SPLIT>. Ascanius this observ'd<SPLIT>, and smiling said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>See<SPLIT>, we devour the plates on which we fed<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The speech had omen<SPLIT>, that the Trojan race Should find repose<SPLIT>, and this the time and place<SPLIT>. Aeneas took the word<SPLIT>, and thus replies<SPLIT>, Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>All hail<SPLIT>, O earth<SPLIT>! all hail<SPLIT>, my household gods<SPLIT>! Behold the destin'd place of your abodes<SPLIT>! For thus Anchises prophesied of old<SPLIT>, And this our fatal place of rest foretold<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>When<SPLIT>, on a foreign shore<SPLIT>, instead of meat<SPLIT>, By famine forc'd<SPLIT>, your trenchers you shall eat<SPLIT>, Then ease your weary Trojans will attend<SPLIT>, And the long labors of your voyage end<SPLIT>. Remember on that happy coast to build<SPLIT>, And with a trench inclose the fruitful field<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' This was that famine<SPLIT>, this the fatal place Which ends the wand<SPLIT>'ring of our exil'd race<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, on to-morrow<SPLIT>'s dawn<SPLIT>, your care employ<SPLIT>, To search the land<SPLIT>, and where the cities lie<SPLIT>, And what the men<SPLIT>; but give this day to joy<SPLIT>. Now pour to Jove<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, after Jove is blest<SPLIT>, Call great Anchises to the genial feast<SPLIT>: Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught<SPLIT>; Enjoy the present hour<SPLIT>; adjourn the future thought<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus having said<SPLIT>, the hero bound his brows With leafy branches<SPLIT>, then perform'd his vows<SPLIT>; Adoring first the genius of the place<SPLIT>, Then Earth<SPLIT>, the mother of the heav'nly race<SPLIT>, The nymphs<SPLIT>, and native godheads yet unknown<SPLIT>, And Night<SPLIT>, and all the stars that gild her sable throne<SPLIT>, And ancient Cybel<SPLIT>, and Idaean Jove<SPLIT>, And last his sire below<SPLIT>, and mother queen above<SPLIT>. Then heav'n<SPLIT>'s high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud<SPLIT>, And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud<SPLIT>. Soon thro<SPLIT>' the joyful camp a rumor flew<SPLIT>, The time was come their city to renew<SPLIT>. Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd<SPLIT>, The feasts are doubled<SPLIT>, and the bowls go round<SPLIT>.
When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day<SPLIT>, The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way<SPLIT>, To learn the natives<SPLIT>' names<SPLIT>, their towns explore<SPLIT>, The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore<SPLIT>: Here Tiber flows<SPLIT>, and here Numicus stands<SPLIT>; Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands<SPLIT>. The pious chief<SPLIT>, who sought by peaceful ways To found his empire<SPLIT>, and his town to raise<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>hundred youths from all his train selects<SPLIT>, And to the Latian court their course directs<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>The spacious palace where their prince resides<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides<SPLIT>. They go commission'd to require a peace<SPLIT>, And carry presents to procure access<SPLIT>. Thus while they speed their pace<SPLIT>, the prince designs His new-elected seat<SPLIT>, and draws the lines<SPLIT>. The Trojans round the place a rampire cast<SPLIT>, And palisades about the trenches plac'd<SPLIT>.
Meantime the train<SPLIT>, proceeding on their way<SPLIT>, From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey<SPLIT>; At length approach the walls<SPLIT>. Without the gate<SPLIT>, They see the boys and Latian youth debate The martial prizes on the dusty plain<SPLIT>: Some drive the cars<SPLIT>, and some the coursers rein<SPLIT>; Some bend the stubborn bow for victory<SPLIT>, And some with darts their active sinews try<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>posting messenger<SPLIT>, dispatch'd from hence<SPLIT>, Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince<SPLIT>, That foreign men of mighty stature came<SPLIT>; Uncouth their habit<SPLIT>, and unknown their name<SPLIT>. The king ordains their entrance<SPLIT>, and ascends His regal seat<SPLIT>, surrounded by his friends<SPLIT>.
The palace built by Picus<SPLIT>, vast and proud<SPLIT>, Supported by a hundred pillars stood<SPLIT>, And round incompass'd with a rising wood<SPLIT>. The pile o<SPLIT>'erlook'd the town<SPLIT>, and drew the sight<SPLIT>; Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight<SPLIT>. There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r<SPLIT>; In state the monarchs march'd<SPLIT>; the lictors bore Their awful axes and the rods before<SPLIT>. Here the tribunal stood<SPLIT>, the house of pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>, And here the sacred senators repair<SPLIT>; All at large tables<SPLIT>, in long order set<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>ram their off'ring<SPLIT>, and a ram their meat<SPLIT>. Above the portal<SPLIT>, carv'd in cedar wood<SPLIT>, Plac'd in their ranks<SPLIT>, their godlike grandsires stood<SPLIT>; Old Saturn<SPLIT>, with his crooked scythe<SPLIT>, on high<SPLIT>; And Italus<SPLIT>, that led the colony<SPLIT>; And ancient Janus<SPLIT>, with his double face<SPLIT>, And bunch of keys<SPLIT>, the porter of the place<SPLIT>. There good Sabinus<SPLIT>, planter of the vines<SPLIT>, On a short pruning hook his head reclines<SPLIT>, And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines<SPLIT>; Then warlike kings<SPLIT>, who for their country fought<SPLIT>, And honorable wounds from battle brought<SPLIT>. Around the posts hung helmets<SPLIT>, darts<SPLIT>, and spears<SPLIT>, And captive chariots<SPLIT>, axes<SPLIT>, shields<SPLIT>, and bars<SPLIT>, And broken beaks of ships<SPLIT>, the trophies of their wars<SPLIT>. Above the rest<SPLIT>, as chief of all the band<SPLIT>, Was Picus plac'd<SPLIT>, a buckler in his hand<SPLIT>; His other wav'd a long divining wand<SPLIT>. Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate<SPLIT>, Yet could not with his art avoid his fate<SPLIT>: For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain<SPLIT>, Till love<SPLIT>, refus'd<SPLIT>, converted to disdain<SPLIT>: Then<SPLIT>, mixing pow'rful herbs<SPLIT>, with magic art<SPLIT>, She chang'd his form<SPLIT>, who could not change his heart<SPLIT>; Constrain'd him in a bird<SPLIT>, and made him fly<SPLIT>, With party-color'd plumes<SPLIT>, a chatt<SPLIT>'ring pie<SPLIT>.
In this high temple<SPLIT>, on a chair of state<SPLIT>, The seat of audience<SPLIT>, old Latinus sate<SPLIT>; Then gave admission to the Trojan train<SPLIT>; And thus with pleasing accents he began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Tell me<SPLIT>, ye Trojans<SPLIT>, for that name you own<SPLIT>, Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown<SPLIT>- Say what you seek<SPLIT>, and whither were you bound<SPLIT>: Were you by stress of weather cast aground<SPLIT>? (<SPLIT>Such dangers as on seas are often seen<SPLIT>, And oft befall to miserable men<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Or come<SPLIT>, your shipping in our ports to lay<SPLIT>, Spent and disabled in so long a way<SPLIT>? Say what you want<SPLIT>: the Latians you shall find Not forc'd to goodness<SPLIT>, but by will inclin'd<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, since the time of Saturn<SPLIT>'s holy reign<SPLIT>, His hospitable customs we retain<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>call to mind (<SPLIT>but time the tale has worn<SPLIT>) Th' Arunci told<SPLIT>, that Dardanus<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' born On Latian plains<SPLIT>, yet sought the Phrygian shore<SPLIT>, And Samothracia<SPLIT>, Samos call'd before<SPLIT>. From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth<SPLIT>; But after<SPLIT>, when exempt from mortal earth<SPLIT>, From thence ascended to his kindred skies<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>god<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, as a god<SPLIT>, augments their sacrifice<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>. Ilioneus made this reply<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O king<SPLIT>, of Faunus<SPLIT>' royal family<SPLIT>! Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way<SPLIT>, Nor did the stars our wand<SPLIT>'ring course betray<SPLIT>. Willing we sought your shores<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, hither bound<SPLIT>, The port<SPLIT>, so long desir'd<SPLIT>, at length we found<SPLIT>; From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd<SPLIT>; Great as the greatest that the sun beheld<SPLIT>. The god began our line<SPLIT>, who rules above<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, as our race<SPLIT>, our king descends from Jove<SPLIT>: And hither are we come<SPLIT>, by his command<SPLIT>, To crave admission in your happy land<SPLIT>. How dire a tempest<SPLIT>, from Mycenae pour'd<SPLIT>, Our plains<SPLIT>, our temples<SPLIT>, and our town devour'd<SPLIT>; What was the waste of war<SPLIT>, what fierce alarms Shook Asia<SPLIT>'s crown with European arms<SPLIT>; Ev'n such have heard<SPLIT>, if any such there be<SPLIT>, Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea<SPLIT>; And such as<SPLIT>, born beneath the burning sky And sultry sun<SPLIT>, betwixt the tropics lie<SPLIT>. From that dire deluge<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' the wat<SPLIT>'ry waste<SPLIT>, Such length of years<SPLIT>, such various perils past<SPLIT>, At last escap'd<SPLIT>, to Latium we repair<SPLIT>, To beg what you without your want may spare<SPLIT>: The common water<SPLIT>, and the common air<SPLIT>; Sheds which ourselves will build<SPLIT>, and mean abodes<SPLIT>, Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods<SPLIT>. Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace<SPLIT>, Nor length of time our gratitude efface<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, what endless honor you shall gain<SPLIT>, To save and shelter Troy<SPLIT>'s unhappy train<SPLIT>! Now<SPLIT>, by my sov'reign<SPLIT>, and his fate<SPLIT>, I swear<SPLIT>, Renown'd for faith in peace<SPLIT>, for force in war<SPLIT>; Oft our alliance other lands desir'd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, what we seek of you<SPLIT>, of us requir'd<SPLIT>. Despite not then<SPLIT>, that in our hands we bear These holy boughs<SPLIT>, sue with words of pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>. Fate and the gods<SPLIT>, by their supreme command<SPLIT>, Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land<SPLIT>. To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends<SPLIT>; Here Dardanus was born<SPLIT>, and hither tends<SPLIT>; Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force<SPLIT>, And where Numicus opes his holy source<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, our prince presents<SPLIT>, with his request<SPLIT>, Some small remains of what his sire possess'd<SPLIT>. This golden charger<SPLIT>, snatch'd from burning Troy<SPLIT>, Anchises did in sacrifice employ<SPLIT>; This royal robe and this tiara wore Old Priam<SPLIT>, and this golden scepter bore In full assemblies<SPLIT>, and in solemn games<SPLIT>; These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus while he spoke<SPLIT>, Latinus roll'd around His eyes<SPLIT>, and fix'd a while upon the ground<SPLIT>. Intent he seem'd<SPLIT>, and anxious in his breast<SPLIT>; Not by the scepter mov'd<SPLIT>, or kingly vest<SPLIT>, But pond<SPLIT>'ring future things of wondrous weight<SPLIT>; Succession<SPLIT>, empire<SPLIT>, and his daughter<SPLIT>'s fate<SPLIT>. On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind<SPLIT>, And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd<SPLIT>. This was the foreign prince<SPLIT>, by fate decreed To share his scepter<SPLIT>, and Lavinia<SPLIT>'s bed<SPLIT>; This was the race that sure portents foreshew To sway the world<SPLIT>, and land and sea subdue<SPLIT>. At length he rais'd his cheerful head<SPLIT>, and spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The pow'rs<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>the pow'rs we both invoke<SPLIT>, To you<SPLIT>, and yours<SPLIT>, and mine<SPLIT>, propitious be<SPLIT>, And firm our purpose with their augury<SPLIT>! Have what you ask<SPLIT>; your presents I receive<SPLIT>; Land<SPLIT>, where and when you please<SPLIT>, with ample leave<SPLIT>; Partake and use my kingdom as your own<SPLIT>; All shall be yours<SPLIT>, while I command the crown<SPLIT>: And<SPLIT>, if my wish'd alliance please your king<SPLIT>, Tell him he should not send the peace<SPLIT>, but bring<SPLIT>. Then let him not a friend<SPLIT>'s embraces fear<SPLIT>; The peace is made when I behold him here<SPLIT>. Besides this answer<SPLIT>, tell my royal guest<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>add to his commands my own request<SPLIT>: One only daughter heirs my crown and state<SPLIT>, Whom not our oracles<SPLIT>, nor Heav'n<SPLIT>, nor fate<SPLIT>, Nor frequent prodigies<SPLIT>, permit to join With any native of th<SPLIT>' Ausonian line<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>foreign son-in-law shall come from far (<SPLIT>Such is our doom<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, a chief renown'd in war<SPLIT>, Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name<SPLIT>, And thro<SPLIT>' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame<SPLIT>. Himself to be the man the fates require<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>firmly judge<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, what I judge<SPLIT>, desire<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>, and then on each bestow'd a steed<SPLIT>. Three hundred horses<SPLIT>, in high stables fed<SPLIT>, Stood ready<SPLIT>, shining all<SPLIT>, and smoothly dress'd<SPLIT>: Of these he chose the fairest and the best<SPLIT>, To mount the Trojan troop<SPLIT>. At his command The steeds caparison'd with purple stand<SPLIT>, With golden trappings<SPLIT>, glorious to behold<SPLIT>, And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold<SPLIT>. Then to his absent guest the king decreed A<SPLIT>pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed<SPLIT>, Who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire<SPLIT>; Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire<SPLIT>, By substituting mares produc'd on earth<SPLIT>, Whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth<SPLIT>. These draw the chariot which Latinus sends<SPLIT>, And the rich present to the prince commends<SPLIT>. Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne<SPLIT>, To their expecting lord with peace return<SPLIT>.
But jealous Juno<SPLIT>, from Pachynus<SPLIT>' height<SPLIT>, As she from Argos took her airy flight<SPLIT>, Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight<SPLIT>. She saw the Trojan and his joyful train Descend upon the shore<SPLIT>, desert the main<SPLIT>, Design a town<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, with unhop'd success<SPLIT>, Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, pierc'd with pain<SPLIT>, she shook her haughty head<SPLIT>, Sigh'd from her inward soul<SPLIT>, and thus she said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes<SPLIT>! O<SPLIT>fates of Troy<SPLIT>, which Juno<SPLIT>'s fates oppose<SPLIT>! Could they not fall unpitied on the plain<SPLIT>, But slain revive<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, taken<SPLIT>, scape again<SPLIT>? When execrable Troy in ashes lay<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way<SPLIT>. Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend<SPLIT>, Her rage disarm'd<SPLIT>, her empire at an end<SPLIT>. Breathless and tir'd<SPLIT>, is all my fury spent<SPLIT>? Or does my glutted spleen at length relent<SPLIT>? As if 't were little from their town to chase<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>thro<SPLIT>' the seas pursued their exil'd race<SPLIT>; Ingag'd the heav'ns<SPLIT>, oppos'd the stormy main<SPLIT>; But billows roar'd<SPLIT>, and tempests rag'd in vain<SPLIT>. What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done<SPLIT>, When these they overpass<SPLIT>, and those they shun<SPLIT>? On Tiber<SPLIT>'s shores they land<SPLIT>, secure of fate<SPLIT>, Triumphant o<SPLIT>'er the storms and Juno<SPLIT>'s hate<SPLIT>. Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe<SPLIT>, And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia<SPLIT>'s wrath<SPLIT>, Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon<SPLIT>; (<SPLIT>What great offense had either people done<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>) But I<SPLIT>, the consort of the Thunderer<SPLIT>, Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war<SPLIT>, With various arts and arms in vain have toil'd<SPLIT>, And by a mortal man at length am foil'd<SPLIT>. If native pow'r prevail not<SPLIT>, shall I doubt To seek for needful succor from without<SPLIT>? If Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny<SPLIT>, Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply<SPLIT>. Grant that the Fates have firm'd<SPLIT>, by their decree<SPLIT>, The Trojan race to reign in Italy<SPLIT>; At least I can defer the nuptial day<SPLIT>, And with protracted wars the peace delay<SPLIT>: With blood the dear alliance shall be bought<SPLIT>, And both the people near destruction brought<SPLIT>; So shall the son-in-law and father join<SPLIT>, With ruin<SPLIT>, war<SPLIT>, and waste of either line<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>fatal maid<SPLIT>, thy marriage is endow'd With Phrygian<SPLIT>, Latian<SPLIT>, and Rutulian blood<SPLIT>! Bellona leads thee to thy lover<SPLIT>'s hand<SPLIT>; Another queen brings forth another brand<SPLIT>, To burn with foreign fires another land<SPLIT>! A<SPLIT>second Paris<SPLIT>, diff'ring but in name<SPLIT>, Shall fire his country with a second flame<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus having said<SPLIT>, she sinks beneath the ground<SPLIT>, With furious haste<SPLIT>, and shoots the Stygian sound<SPLIT>, To rouse Alecto from th<SPLIT>' infernal seat Of her dire sisters<SPLIT>, and their dark retreat<SPLIT>. This Fury<SPLIT>, fit for her intent<SPLIT>, she chose<SPLIT>; One who delights in wars and human woes<SPLIT>. Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race<SPLIT>; Her sister Furies fly her hideous face<SPLIT>; So frightful are the forms the monster takes<SPLIT>, So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes<SPLIT>. Her Juno finds<SPLIT>, and thus inflames her spite<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O virgin daughter of eternal Night<SPLIT>, Give me this once thy labor<SPLIT>, to sustain My right<SPLIT>, and execute my just disdain<SPLIT>. Let not the Trojans<SPLIT>, with a feign'd pretense Of proffer'd peace<SPLIT>, delude the Latian prince<SPLIT>. Expel from Italy that odious name<SPLIT>, And let not Juno suffer in her fame<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is thine to ruin realms<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'erturn a state<SPLIT>, Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate<SPLIT>, And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate<SPLIT>. Thy hand o<SPLIT>'er towns the fun'ral torch displays<SPLIT>, And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways<SPLIT>. Now shake<SPLIT>, out thy fruitful breast<SPLIT>, the seeds Of envy<SPLIT>, discord<SPLIT>, and of cruel deeds<SPLIT>: Confound the peace establish'd<SPLIT>, and prepare Their souls to hatred<SPLIT>, and their hands to war<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood<SPLIT>, The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood<SPLIT>; And on her wicker wings<SPLIT>, sublime thro<SPLIT>' night<SPLIT>, She to the Latian palace took her flight<SPLIT>: There sought the queen<SPLIT>'s apartment<SPLIT>, stood before The peaceful threshold<SPLIT>, and besieg'd the door<SPLIT>. Restless Amata lay<SPLIT>, her swelling breast Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd<SPLIT>, And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest<SPLIT>. From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes Her darling plague<SPLIT>, the fav'rite of her snakes<SPLIT>; With her full force she threw the poisonous dart<SPLIT>, And fix'd it deep within Amata<SPLIT>'s heart<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, thus envenom'd<SPLIT>, she might kindle rage<SPLIT>, And sacrifice to strife her house husband<SPLIT>'s age<SPLIT>. Unseen<SPLIT>, unfelt<SPLIT>, the fiery serpent skims Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs<SPLIT>; His baleful breath inspiring<SPLIT>, as he glides<SPLIT>, Now like a chain around her neck he rides<SPLIT>, Now like a fillet to her head repairs<SPLIT>, And with his circling volumes folds her hairs<SPLIT>. At first the silent venom slid with ease<SPLIT>, And seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, ere th<SPLIT>' infected mass was fir'd too far<SPLIT>, In plaintive accents she began the war<SPLIT>, And thus bespoke her husband<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Shall<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>A wand<SPLIT>'ring prince enjoy Lavinia<SPLIT>'s bed<SPLIT>? If nature plead not in a parent<SPLIT>'s heart<SPLIT>, Pity my tears<SPLIT>, and pity her desert<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>know<SPLIT>, my dearest lord<SPLIT>, the time will come<SPLIT>, You in vain<SPLIT>, reverse your cruel doom<SPLIT>; The faithless pirate soon will set to sea<SPLIT>, And bear the royal virgin far away<SPLIT>! A<SPLIT>guest like him<SPLIT>, a Trojan guest before<SPLIT>, In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore<SPLIT>, And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore<SPLIT>. Think on a king<SPLIT>'s inviolable word<SPLIT>; And think on Turnus<SPLIT>, her once plighted lord<SPLIT>: To this false foreigner you give your throne<SPLIT>, And wrong a friend<SPLIT>, a kinsman<SPLIT>, and a son<SPLIT>. Resume your ancient care<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, if the god Your sire<SPLIT>, and you<SPLIT>, resolve on foreign blood<SPLIT>, Know all are foreign<SPLIT>, in a larger sense<SPLIT>, Not born your subjects<SPLIT>, or deriv'd from hence<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, if the line of Turnus you retrace<SPLIT>, He springs from Inachus of Argive race<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
But when she saw her reasons idly spent<SPLIT>, And could not move him from his fix'd intent<SPLIT>, She flew to rage<SPLIT>; for now the snake possess'd Her vital parts<SPLIT>, and poison'd all her breast<SPLIT>; She raves<SPLIT>, she runs with a distracted pace<SPLIT>, And fills with horrid howls the public place<SPLIT>. And<SPLIT>, as young striplings whip the top for sport<SPLIT>, On the smooth pavement of an empty court<SPLIT>; The wooden engine flies and whirls about<SPLIT>, Admir'd<SPLIT>, with clamors<SPLIT>, of the beardless rout<SPLIT>; They lash aloud<SPLIT>; each other they provoke<SPLIT>, And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke<SPLIT>: Thus fares the queen<SPLIT>; and thus her fury blows Amidst the crowd<SPLIT>, and kindles as she goes<SPLIT>. Nor yet content<SPLIT>, she strains her malice more<SPLIT>, And adds new ills to those contriv'd before<SPLIT>: She flies the town<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, mixing with a throng Of madding matrons<SPLIT>, bears the bride along<SPLIT>, Wand<SPLIT>'ring thro<SPLIT>' woods and wilds<SPLIT>, and devious ways<SPLIT>, And with these arts the Trojan match delays<SPLIT>. She feign'd the rites of Bacchus<SPLIT>; cried aloud<SPLIT>, And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Evoe<SPLIT>! O Bacchus<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" thus began the song<SPLIT>; And "<SPLIT>Evoe<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" answer'd all the female throng<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>O virgin<SPLIT>! worthy thee alone<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" she cried<SPLIT>; "<SPLIT>O worthy thee alone<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" the crew replied<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>For thee she feeds her hair<SPLIT>, she leads thy dance<SPLIT>, And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Like fury seiz'd the rest<SPLIT>; the progress known<SPLIT>, All seek the mountains<SPLIT>, and forsake the town<SPLIT>: All<SPLIT>, clad in skins of beasts<SPLIT>, the jav'lin bear<SPLIT>, Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair<SPLIT>, And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air<SPLIT>. The queen herself<SPLIT>, inspir'd with rage divine<SPLIT>, Shook high above her head a flaming pine<SPLIT>; Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng<SPLIT>, And sung<SPLIT>, in Turnus<SPLIT>' name<SPLIT>, the nuptial song<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Io<SPLIT>, ye Latian dames<SPLIT>! if any here Hold your unhappy queen<SPLIT>, Amata<SPLIT>, dear<SPLIT>; If there be here<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>who dare maintain My right<SPLIT>, nor think the name of mother vain<SPLIT>; Unbind your fillets<SPLIT>, loose your flowing hair<SPLIT>, And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Amata<SPLIT>'s breast the Fury thus invades<SPLIT>, And fires with rage<SPLIT>, amid the sylvan shades<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, when she found her venom spread so far<SPLIT>, The royal house embroil'd in civil war<SPLIT>, Rais'd on her dusky wings<SPLIT>, she cleaves the skies<SPLIT>, And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies<SPLIT>. His town<SPLIT>, as fame reports<SPLIT>, was built of old By Danae<SPLIT>, pregnant with almighty gold<SPLIT>, Who fled her father<SPLIT>'s rage<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, with a train Of following Argives<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' the stormy main<SPLIT>, Driv'n by the southern blasts<SPLIT>, was fated here to reign<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T was Ardua once<SPLIT>; now Ardea<SPLIT>'s name it bears<SPLIT>; Once a fair city<SPLIT>, now consum'd with years<SPLIT>. Here<SPLIT>, in his lofty palace<SPLIT>, Turnus lay<SPLIT>, Betwixt the confines of the night and day<SPLIT>, Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside Her looks and limbs<SPLIT>, and with new methods tried The foulness of th<SPLIT>' infernal form to hide<SPLIT>. Propp'd on a staff<SPLIT>, she takes a trembling mien<SPLIT>: Her face is furrow'd<SPLIT>, and her front obscene<SPLIT>; Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws<SPLIT>; Sunk are her eyes<SPLIT>, and toothless are her jaws<SPLIT>; Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound<SPLIT>, Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd<SPLIT>. Old Chalybe<SPLIT>, who kept the sacred fane Of Juno<SPLIT>, now she seem'd<SPLIT>, and thus began<SPLIT>, Appearing in a dream<SPLIT>, to rouse the careless man<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain In fighting fields<SPLIT>, and conquer towns in vain<SPLIT>? Win<SPLIT>, for a Trojan head to wear the prize<SPLIT>, Usurp thy crown<SPLIT>, enjoy thy victories<SPLIT>? The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought<SPLIT>, The king transfers<SPLIT>; and foreign heirs are sought<SPLIT>. Go now<SPLIT>, deluded man<SPLIT>, and seek again New toils<SPLIT>, new dangers<SPLIT>, on the dusty plain<SPLIT>. Repel the Tuscan foes<SPLIT>; their city seize<SPLIT>; Protect the Latians in luxurious ease<SPLIT>. This dream all-pow'rful Juno sends<SPLIT>; I bear Her mighty mandates<SPLIT>, and her words you hear<SPLIT>. Haste<SPLIT>; arm your Ardeans<SPLIT>; issue to the plain<SPLIT>; With fate to friend<SPLIT>, assault the Trojan train<SPLIT>: Their thoughtless chiefs<SPLIT>, their painted ships<SPLIT>, that lie In Tiber<SPLIT>'s mouth<SPLIT>, with fire and sword destroy<SPLIT>. The Latian king<SPLIT>, unless he shall submit<SPLIT>, Own his old promise<SPLIT>, and his new forget- Let him<SPLIT>, in arms<SPLIT>, the pow'r of Turnus prove<SPLIT>, And learn to fear whom he disdains to love<SPLIT>. For such is Heav'n<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The youthful prince With scorn replied<SPLIT>, and made this bold defense<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>You tell me<SPLIT>, mother<SPLIT>, what I knew before<SPLIT>: The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>neither fear nor will provoke the war<SPLIT>; My fate is Juno<SPLIT>'s most peculiar care<SPLIT>. But time has made you dote<SPLIT>, and vainly tell Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell<SPLIT>. Go<SPLIT>; be the temple and the gods your care<SPLIT>; Permit to men the thought of peace and war<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
These haughty words Alecto<SPLIT>'s rage provoke<SPLIT>, And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke<SPLIT>. Her eyes grow stiffen'd<SPLIT>, and with sulphur burn<SPLIT>; Her hideous looks and hellish form return<SPLIT>; Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place<SPLIT>, And open all the furies of her face<SPLIT>: Then<SPLIT>, darting fire from her malignant eyes<SPLIT>, She cast him backward as he strove to rise<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, ling<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>, sought to frame some new replies<SPLIT>. High on her head she rears two twisted snakes<SPLIT>, Her chains she rattles<SPLIT>, and her whip she shakes<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, churning bloody foam<SPLIT>, thus loudly speaks<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Behold whom time has made to dote<SPLIT>, and tell Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell<SPLIT>! Behold the Fates<SPLIT>' infernal minister<SPLIT>! War<SPLIT>, death<SPLIT>, destruction<SPLIT>, in my hand I bear<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus having said<SPLIT>, her smold<SPLIT>'ring torch<SPLIT>, impress'd With her full force<SPLIT>, she plung'd into his breast<SPLIT>. Aghast he wak'd<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, starting from his bed<SPLIT>, Cold sweat<SPLIT>, in clammy drops<SPLIT>, his limbs o<SPLIT>'erspread<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Arms<SPLIT>! arms<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" he cries<SPLIT>: "my sword and shield prepare<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" He breathes defiance<SPLIT>, blood<SPLIT>, and mortal war<SPLIT>. So<SPLIT>, when with crackling flames a caldron fries<SPLIT>, The bubbling waters from the bottom rise<SPLIT>: Above the brims they force their fiery way<SPLIT>; Black vapors climb aloft<SPLIT>, and cloud the day<SPLIT>.
The peace polluted thus<SPLIT>, a chosen band He first commissions to the Latian land<SPLIT>, In threat<SPLIT>'ning embassy<SPLIT>; then rais'd the rest<SPLIT>, To meet in arms th<SPLIT>' intruding Trojan guest<SPLIT>, To force the foes from the Lavinian shore<SPLIT>, And Italy<SPLIT>'s indanger'd peace restore<SPLIT>. Himself alone an equal match he boasts<SPLIT>, To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts<SPLIT>. The gods invok'd<SPLIT>, the Rutuli prepare Their arms<SPLIT>, and warn each other to the war<SPLIT>. His beauty these<SPLIT>, and those his blooming age<SPLIT>, The rest his house and his own fame ingage<SPLIT>.
While Turnus urges thus his enterprise<SPLIT>, The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies<SPLIT>; New frauds invents<SPLIT>, and takes a steepy stand<SPLIT>, Which overlooks the vale with wide command<SPLIT>; Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train<SPLIT>, With horns and hounds<SPLIT>, a hunting match ordain<SPLIT>, And pitch their toils around the shady plain<SPLIT>. The Fury fires the pack<SPLIT>; they snuff<SPLIT>, they vent<SPLIT>, And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>Twas of a well-grown stag<SPLIT>, whose antlers rise High o<SPLIT>'er his front<SPLIT>; his beams invade the skies<SPLIT>. From this light cause th<SPLIT>' infernal maid prepares The country churls to mischief<SPLIT>, hate<SPLIT>, and wars<SPLIT>.
The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred<SPLIT>, Snatch'd from his dams<SPLIT>, and the tame youngling fed<SPLIT>. Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring<SPLIT>, Tyrrheus<SPLIT>, chief ranger to the Latian king<SPLIT>: Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care The little wanton<SPLIT>, and did wreaths prepare To hang his budding horns<SPLIT>, with ribbons tied His tender neck<SPLIT>, and comb'd his silken hide<SPLIT>, And bathed his body<SPLIT>. Patient of command In time he grew<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, growing us'd to hand<SPLIT>, He waited at his master<SPLIT>'s board for food<SPLIT>; Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood<SPLIT>, Where grazing all the day<SPLIT>, at night he came To his known lodgings<SPLIT>, and his country dame<SPLIT>.
This household beast<SPLIT>, that us'd the woodland grounds<SPLIT>, Was view'd at first by the young hero<SPLIT>'s hounds<SPLIT>, As down the stream he swam<SPLIT>, to seek retreat In the cool waters<SPLIT>, and to quench his heat<SPLIT>. Ascanius young<SPLIT>, and eager of his game<SPLIT>, Soon bent his bow<SPLIT>, uncertain in his aim<SPLIT>; But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides<SPLIT>, Which pierc'd his bowels thro<SPLIT>' his panting sides<SPLIT>. The bleeding creature issues from the floods<SPLIT>, Possess'd with fear<SPLIT>, and seeks his known abodes<SPLIT>, His old familiar hearth and household gods<SPLIT>. He falls<SPLIT>; he fills the house with heavy groans<SPLIT>, Implores their pity<SPLIT>, and his pain bemoans<SPLIT>. Young Silvia beats her breast<SPLIT>, and cries aloud For succor from the clownish neighborhood<SPLIT>: The churls assemble<SPLIT>; for the fiend<SPLIT>, who lay In the close woody covert<SPLIT>, urg'd their way<SPLIT>. One with a brand yet burning from the flame<SPLIT>, Arm'd with a knotty club another came<SPLIT>: Whate<SPLIT>'er they catch or find<SPLIT>, without their care<SPLIT>, Their fury makes an instrument of war<SPLIT>. Tyrrheus<SPLIT>, the foster father of the beast<SPLIT>, Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist<SPLIT>, But held his hand from the descending stroke<SPLIT>, And left his wedge within the cloven oak<SPLIT>, To whet their courage and their rage provoke<SPLIT>. And now the goddess<SPLIT>, exercis'd in ill<SPLIT>, Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will<SPLIT>, Ascends the roof<SPLIT>, and to her crooked horn<SPLIT>, Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne<SPLIT>, Adds all her breath<SPLIT>: the rocks and woods around<SPLIT>, And mountains<SPLIT>, tremble at th<SPLIT>' infernal sound<SPLIT>. The sacred lake of Trivia from afar<SPLIT>, The Veline fountains<SPLIT>, and sulphureous Nar<SPLIT>, Shake at the baleful blast<SPLIT>, the signal of the war<SPLIT>. Young mothers wildly stare<SPLIT>, with fear possess'd<SPLIT>, And strain their helpless infants to their breast<SPLIT>.
The clowns<SPLIT>, a boist<SPLIT>'rous<SPLIT>, rude<SPLIT>, ungover<SPLIT>n'd crew<SPLIT>, With furious haste to the loud summons flew<SPLIT>. The pow'rs of Troy<SPLIT>, then issuing on the plain<SPLIT>, With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain<SPLIT>: Not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train<SPLIT>, But a firm body of embattled men<SPLIT>. At first<SPLIT>, while fortune favor'd neither side<SPLIT>, The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried<SPLIT>; But now<SPLIT>, both parties reinforc'd<SPLIT>, the fields Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>shining harvest either host displays<SPLIT>, And shoots against the sun with equal rays<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise<SPLIT>, White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries<SPLIT>; Then roars the main<SPLIT>, the billows mount the skies<SPLIT>; Till<SPLIT>, by the fury of the storm full blown<SPLIT>, The muddy bottom o<SPLIT>'er the clouds is thrown<SPLIT>. First Almon falls<SPLIT>, old Tyrrheus<SPLIT>' eldest care<SPLIT>, Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war<SPLIT>: Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood<SPLIT>, And stopp'd his breath<SPLIT>, and drank his vital blood Huge heaps of slain around the body rise<SPLIT>: Among the rest<SPLIT>, the rich Galesus lies<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>good old man<SPLIT>, while peace he preach'd in vain<SPLIT>, Amidst the madness of th<SPLIT>' unruly train<SPLIT>: Five herds<SPLIT>, five bleating flocks<SPLIT>, his pastures fill'd<SPLIT>; His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd<SPLIT>.
Thus<SPLIT>, while in equal scales their fortune stood The Fury bath'd them in each other<SPLIT>'s blood<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, having fix'd the fight<SPLIT>, exulting flies<SPLIT>, And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies<SPLIT>. To Juno thus she speaks<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Behold<SPLIT>! It is done<SPLIT>, The blood already drawn<SPLIT>, the war begun<SPLIT>; The discord is complete<SPLIT>; nor can they cease The dire debate<SPLIT>, nor you command the peace<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, since the Latian and the Trojan brood Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood<SPLIT>; Speak<SPLIT>, and my pow'r shall add this office more<SPLIT>: The neighb'ing nations of th<SPLIT>' Ausonian shore Shall hear the dreadful rumor<SPLIT>, from afar<SPLIT>, Of arm'd invasion<SPLIT>, and embrace the war<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then Juno thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The grateful work is done<SPLIT>, The seeds of discord sow'd<SPLIT>, the war begun<SPLIT>; Frauds<SPLIT>, fears<SPLIT>, and fury have possess'd the state<SPLIT>, And fix'd the causes of a lasting hate<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>bloody Hymen shall th<SPLIT>' alliance join Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line<SPLIT>: But thou with speed to night and hell repair<SPLIT>; For not the gods<SPLIT>, nor angry Jove<SPLIT>, will bear Thy lawless wand<SPLIT>'ring walks in upper air<SPLIT>. Leave what remains to me<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Saturnia said<SPLIT>: The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd<SPLIT>, Unwilling left the light<SPLIT>, and sought the nether shade<SPLIT>.
In midst of Italy<SPLIT>, well known to fame<SPLIT>, There lies a lake (<SPLIT>Amsanctus is the name<SPLIT>) Below the lofty mounts<SPLIT>: on either side Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide<SPLIT>. Full in the center of the sacred wood An arm arises of the Stygian flood<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound<SPLIT>, Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around<SPLIT>. Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell<SPLIT>, And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell<SPLIT>. To this infernal lake the Fury flies<SPLIT>; Here hides her hated head<SPLIT>, and frees the lab'ring skies<SPLIT>.
Saturnian Juno now<SPLIT>, with double care<SPLIT>, Attends the fatal process of the war<SPLIT>. The clowns<SPLIT>, return'd<SPLIT>, from battle bear the slain<SPLIT>, Implore the gods<SPLIT>, and to their king complain<SPLIT>. The corps of Almon and the rest are shown<SPLIT>; Shrieks<SPLIT>, clamors<SPLIT>, murmurs<SPLIT>, fill the frighted town<SPLIT>. Ambitious Turnus in the press appears<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, aggravating crimes<SPLIT>, augments their fears<SPLIT>; Proclaims his private injuries aloud<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>solemn promise made<SPLIT>, and disavow'd<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>foreign son is sought<SPLIT>, and a mix'd mungril brood<SPLIT>. Then they<SPLIT>, whose mothers<SPLIT>, frantic with their fear<SPLIT>, In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear<SPLIT>, And lead his dances with dishevel'd hair<SPLIT>, Increase the clamor<SPLIT>, and the war demand<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Such was Amata<SPLIT>'s interest in the land<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Against the public sanctions of the peace<SPLIT>, Against all omens of their ill success<SPLIT>. With fates averse<SPLIT>, the rout in arms resort<SPLIT>, To force their monarch<SPLIT>, and insult the court<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, like a rock unmov'd<SPLIT>, a rock that braves The raging tempest and the rising waves<SPLIT>- Propp'd on himself he stands<SPLIT>; his solid sides Wash off the seaweeds<SPLIT>, and the sounding tides<SPLIT>- So stood the pious prince<SPLIT>, unmov'd<SPLIT>, and long Sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, when he found that Juno<SPLIT>'s pow'r prevail'd<SPLIT>, And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd<SPLIT>, He calls the gods to witness their offense<SPLIT>, Disclaims the war<SPLIT>, asserts his innocence<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Hurried by fate<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he cries<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>and borne before A<SPLIT>furious wind<SPLIT>, we have the faithful shore<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>more than madmen<SPLIT>! you yourselves shall bear The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war<SPLIT>: Thou<SPLIT>, Turnus<SPLIT>, shalt atone it by thy fate<SPLIT>, And pray to Heav'n for peace<SPLIT>, but pray too late<SPLIT>. For me<SPLIT>, my stormy voyage at an end<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>to the port of death securely tend<SPLIT>. The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay<SPLIT>, Is all I want<SPLIT>, and all you take away<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said no more<SPLIT>, but<SPLIT>, in his walls confin'd<SPLIT>, Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive<SPLIT>, But left the helm<SPLIT>, and let the vessel drive<SPLIT>.
A<SPLIT>solemn custom was observ'd of old<SPLIT>, Which Latium held<SPLIT>, and now the Romans hold<SPLIT>, Their standard when in fighting fields they rear Against the fierce Hyrcanians<SPLIT>, or declare The Scythian<SPLIT>, Indian<SPLIT>, or Arabian war<SPLIT>; Or from the boasting Parthians would regain Their eagles<SPLIT>, lost in Carrhae<SPLIT>'s bloody plain<SPLIT>. Two gates of steel (<SPLIT>the name of Mars they bear<SPLIT>, And still are worship'd with religious fear<SPLIT>) Before his temple stand<SPLIT>: the dire abode<SPLIT>, And the fear'd issues of the furious god<SPLIT>, Are fenc'd with brazen bolts<SPLIT>; without the gates<SPLIT>, The wary guardian Janus doubly waits<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, when the sacred senate votes the wars<SPLIT>, The Roman consul their decree declares<SPLIT>, And in his robes the sounding gates unbars<SPLIT>. The youth in military shouts arise<SPLIT>, And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies<SPLIT>. These rites<SPLIT>, of old by sov'reign princes us'd<SPLIT>, Were the king<SPLIT>'s office<SPLIT>; but the king refus'd<SPLIT>, Deaf to their cries<SPLIT>, nor would the gates unbar Of sacred peace<SPLIT>, or loose th<SPLIT>' imprison'd war<SPLIT>; But hid his head<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, safe from loud alarms<SPLIT>, Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms<SPLIT>. Then heav'n<SPLIT>'s imperious queen shot down from high<SPLIT>: At her approach the brazen hinges fly<SPLIT>; The gates are forc'd<SPLIT>, and ev'ry falling bar<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, like a tempest<SPLIT>, issues out the war<SPLIT>.
The peaceful cities of th<SPLIT>' Ausonian shore<SPLIT>, Lull'd in their ease<SPLIT>, and undisturb'd before<SPLIT>, Are all on fire<SPLIT>; and some<SPLIT>, with studious care<SPLIT>, Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare<SPLIT>; Some their soft limbs in painful marches try<SPLIT>, And war is all their wish<SPLIT>, and arms the gen'ral cry<SPLIT>. Part scour the rusty shields with seam<SPLIT>; and part New grind the blunted ax<SPLIT>, and point the dart<SPLIT>: With joy they view the waving ensigns fly<SPLIT>, And hear the trumpet<SPLIT>'s clangor pierce the sky<SPLIT>. Five cities forge their arms<SPLIT>: th<SPLIT>' Atinian pow'rs<SPLIT>, Antemnae<SPLIT>, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs<SPLIT>, Ardea the proud<SPLIT>, the Crustumerian town<SPLIT>: All these of old were places of renown<SPLIT>. Some hammer helmets for the fighting field<SPLIT>; Some twine young sallows to support the shield<SPLIT>; The croslet some<SPLIT>, and some the cuishes mold<SPLIT>, With silver plated<SPLIT>, and with ductile gold<SPLIT>. The rustic honors of the scythe and share Give place to swords and plumes<SPLIT>, the pride of war<SPLIT>. Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires<SPLIT>; The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires<SPLIT>. The word is giv'n<SPLIT>; with eager speed they lace The shining headpiece<SPLIT>, and the shield embrace<SPLIT>. The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied<SPLIT>; The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side<SPLIT>.
And now the mighty labor is begun Ye Muses<SPLIT>, open all your Helicon<SPLIT>. Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th<SPLIT>' Ausonian land<SPLIT>, Their arms<SPLIT>, and armies under their command<SPLIT>; What warriors in our ancient clime were bred<SPLIT>; What soldiers follow'd<SPLIT>, and what heroes led<SPLIT>. For well you know<SPLIT>, and can record alone<SPLIT>, What fame to future times conveys but darkly down<SPLIT>. Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain<SPLIT>: Scorn sate upon his brows<SPLIT>, and sour disdain<SPLIT>, Defying earth and heav'n<SPLIT>. Etruria lost<SPLIT>, He brings to Turnus<SPLIT>' aid his baffled host<SPLIT>. The charming Lausus<SPLIT>, full of youthful fire<SPLIT>, Rode in the rank<SPLIT>, and next his sullen sire<SPLIT>; To Turnus only second in the grace Of manly mien<SPLIT>, and features of the face<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>skilful horseman<SPLIT>, and a huntsman bred<SPLIT>, With fates averse a thousand men he led<SPLIT>: His sire unworthy of so brave a son<SPLIT>; Himself well worthy of a happier throne<SPLIT>.
Next Aventinus drives his chariot round The Latian plains<SPLIT>, with palms and laurels crown'd<SPLIT>. Proud of his steeds<SPLIT>, he smokes along the field<SPLIT>; His father<SPLIT>'s hydra fills his ample shield<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>hundred serpents hiss about the brims<SPLIT>; The son of Hercules he justly seems By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs<SPLIT>; Of heav'nly part<SPLIT>, and part of earthly blood<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>mortal woman mixing with a god<SPLIT>. For strong Alcides<SPLIT>, after he had slain The triple Geryon<SPLIT>, drove from conquer'd Spain His captive herds<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, thence in triumph led<SPLIT>, On Tuscan Tiber<SPLIT>'s flow<SPLIT>'ry banks they fed<SPLIT>. Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove The priestess Rhea found<SPLIT>, and forc'd to love<SPLIT>. For arms<SPLIT>, his men long piles and jav'lins bore<SPLIT>; And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore<SPLIT>. Like Hercules himself his son appears<SPLIT>, In salvage pomp<SPLIT>; a lion<SPLIT>'s hide he wears<SPLIT>; About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin<SPLIT>; The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, like the god his father<SPLIT>, homely dress'd<SPLIT>, He strides into the hall<SPLIT>, a horrid guest<SPLIT>.
Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Which from their brother Tiburs took the name<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Fierce Coras and Catillus<SPLIT>, void of fear<SPLIT>: Arm'd Argive horse they led<SPLIT>, and in the front appear<SPLIT>. Like cloud-born Centaurs<SPLIT>, from the mountain<SPLIT>'s height With rapid course descending to the fight<SPLIT>; They rush along<SPLIT>; the rattling woods give way<SPLIT>; The branches bend before their sweepy sway<SPLIT>.
Nor was Praeneste<SPLIT>'s founder wanting there<SPLIT>, Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber<SPLIT>: Found in the fire<SPLIT>, and foster'd in the plains<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>shepherd and a king at once he reigns<SPLIT>, And leads to Turnus<SPLIT>' aid his country swains<SPLIT>. His own Praeneste sends a chosen band<SPLIT>, With those who plow Saturnia<SPLIT>'s Gabine land<SPLIT>; Besides the succor which cold Anien yields<SPLIT>, The rocks of Hernicus<SPLIT>, and dewy fields<SPLIT>, Anagnia fat<SPLIT>, and Father Amasene<SPLIT>- A<SPLIT>num<SPLIT>'rous rout<SPLIT>, but all of naked men<SPLIT>: Nor arms they wear<SPLIT>, nor swords and bucklers wield<SPLIT>, Nor drive the chariot thro<SPLIT>' the dusty field<SPLIT>, But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead<SPLIT>, And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head<SPLIT>; The left foot naked<SPLIT>, when they march to fight<SPLIT>, But in a bull<SPLIT>'s raw hide they sheathe the right<SPLIT>. Messapus next<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>great Neptune was his sire<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Secure of steel<SPLIT>, and fated from the fire<SPLIT>, In pomp appears<SPLIT>, and with his ardor warms A<SPLIT>heartless train<SPLIT>, unexercis'd in arms<SPLIT>: The just Faliscans he to battle brings<SPLIT>, And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs<SPLIT>; And where Feronia<SPLIT>'s grove and temple stands<SPLIT>, Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands<SPLIT>. All these in order march<SPLIT>, and marching sing The warlike actions of their sea-born king<SPLIT>; Like a long team of snowy swans on high<SPLIT>, Which clap their wings<SPLIT>, and cleave the liquid sky<SPLIT>, When<SPLIT>, homeward from their wat<SPLIT>'ry pastures borne<SPLIT>, They sing<SPLIT>, and Asia<SPLIT>'s lakes their notes return<SPLIT>. Not one who heard their music from afar<SPLIT>, Would think these troops an army train'd to war<SPLIT>, But flocks of fowl<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, when the tempests roar<SPLIT>, With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore<SPLIT>.
Then Clausus came<SPLIT>, who led a num<SPLIT>'rous band Of troops embodied from the Sabine land<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, in himself alone<SPLIT>, an army brought<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T was he<SPLIT>, the noble Claudian race begot<SPLIT>, The Claudian race<SPLIT>, ordain'd<SPLIT>, in times to come<SPLIT>, To share the greatness of imperial Rome<SPLIT>. He led the Cures forth<SPLIT>, of old renown<SPLIT>, Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town<SPLIT>, And all th<SPLIT>' Eretian pow'rs<SPLIT>; besides a band That follow'd from Velinum<SPLIT>'s dewy land<SPLIT>, And Amiternian troops<SPLIT>, of mighty fame<SPLIT>, And mountaineers<SPLIT>, that from Severus came<SPLIT>, And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica<SPLIT>, And those where yellow Tiber takes his way<SPLIT>, And where Himella<SPLIT>'s wanton waters play<SPLIT>. Casperia sends her arms<SPLIT>, with those that lie By Fabaris<SPLIT>, and fruitful Foruli<SPLIT>: The warlike aids of Horta next appear<SPLIT>, And the cold Nursians come to close the rear<SPLIT>, Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood<SPLIT>, Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood<SPLIT>. Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main<SPLIT>, When pale Orion sets in wintry rain<SPLIT>; Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise<SPLIT>, Or Lycian fields<SPLIT>, when Phoebus burns the skies<SPLIT>, Than stand these troops<SPLIT>: their bucklers ring around<SPLIT>; Their trampling turns the turf<SPLIT>, and shakes the solid ground<SPLIT>.
High in his chariot then Halesus came<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>foe by birth to Troy<SPLIT>'s unhappy name<SPLIT>: From Agamemnon born<SPLIT>- to Turnus<SPLIT>' aid A<SPLIT>thousand men the youthful hero led<SPLIT>, Who till the Massic soil<SPLIT>, for wine renown'd<SPLIT>, And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground<SPLIT>, And those who live by Sidicinian shores<SPLIT>, And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars<SPLIT>, Cales<SPLIT>' and Osca<SPLIT>'s old inhabitants<SPLIT>, And rough Saticulans<SPLIT>, inur'd to wants<SPLIT>: Light demi-lances from afar they throw<SPLIT>, Fasten'd with leathern thongs<SPLIT>, to gall the foe<SPLIT>. Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear<SPLIT>; And on their warding arm light bucklers bear<SPLIT>.
Nor Oebalus<SPLIT>, shalt thou be left unsung<SPLIT>, From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung<SPLIT>, Who then in Teleboan Capri reign'd<SPLIT>; But that short isle th<SPLIT>' ambitious youth disdain'd<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway<SPLIT>, Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea<SPLIT>; O'er Batulum<SPLIT>, and where Abella sees<SPLIT>, From her high tow'rs<SPLIT>, the harvest of her trees<SPLIT>. And these (<SPLIT>as was the Teuton use of old<SPLIT>) Wield brazen swords<SPLIT>, and brazen bucklers hold<SPLIT>; Sling weighty stones<SPLIT>, when from afar they fight<SPLIT>; Their casques are cork<SPLIT>, a covering thick and light<SPLIT>.
Next these in rank<SPLIT>, the warlike Ufens went<SPLIT>, And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent<SPLIT>. The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd<SPLIT>; Hunting their sport<SPLIT>, and plund<SPLIT>'ring was their trade<SPLIT>. In arms they plow'd<SPLIT>, to battle still prepar'd<SPLIT>: Their soil was barren<SPLIT>, and their hearts were hard<SPLIT>.
Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led<SPLIT>, By King Archippus sent to Turnus<SPLIT>' aid<SPLIT>, And peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head<SPLIT>. His wand and holy words<SPLIT>, the viper<SPLIT>'s rage<SPLIT>, And venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage<SPLIT>. He<SPLIT>, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep Their temples<SPLIT>, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep. But vain were Marsian herbs<SPLIT>, and magic art<SPLIT>, To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart<SPLIT>: Yet his untimely fate th<SPLIT>' Angitian woods In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods<SPLIT>.
The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there<SPLIT>, Fam'd as his sire<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, as his mother<SPLIT>, fair<SPLIT>; Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore<SPLIT>, And nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore<SPLIT>, Where great Diana<SPLIT>'s peaceful altars flame<SPLIT>, In fruitful fields<SPLIT>; and Virbius was his name<SPLIT>. Hippolytus<SPLIT>, as old records have said<SPLIT>, Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, when no female arts his mind could move<SPLIT>, She turn'd to furious hate her impious love<SPLIT>. Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore<SPLIT>, Another<SPLIT>'s crimes th<SPLIT>' unhappy hunter bore<SPLIT>, Glutting his father<SPLIT>'s eyes with guiltless gore<SPLIT>. But chaste Diana<SPLIT>, who his death deplor'd<SPLIT>, With Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd<SPLIT>. Then Jove<SPLIT>, who saw from high<SPLIT>, with just disdain<SPLIT>, The dead inspir'd with vital breath again<SPLIT>, Struck to the center<SPLIT>, with his flaming dart<SPLIT>, Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art<SPLIT>. But Trivia kept in secret shades alone Her care<SPLIT>, Hippolytus<SPLIT>, to fate unknown<SPLIT>; And call'd him Virbius in th<SPLIT>' Egerian grove<SPLIT>, Where then he liv'd obscure<SPLIT>, but safe from Jove<SPLIT>. For this<SPLIT>, from Trivia<SPLIT>'s temple and her wood Are coursers driv'n<SPLIT>, who shed their master<SPLIT>'s blood<SPLIT>, Affrighted by the monsters of the flood<SPLIT>. His son<SPLIT>, the second Virbius<SPLIT>, yet retain'd His father<SPLIT>'s art<SPLIT>, and warrior steeds he rein'd<SPLIT>.
Amid the troops<SPLIT>, and like the leading god<SPLIT>, High o<SPLIT>'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>triple of plumes his crest adorn'd<SPLIT>, On which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd<SPLIT>: The more the kindled combat rises high'r<SPLIT>, The more with fury burns the blazing fire<SPLIT>. Fair Io grac'd his shield<SPLIT>; but Io now With horns exalted stands<SPLIT>, and seems to low<SPLIT>- A<SPLIT>noble charge<SPLIT>! Her keeper by her side<SPLIT>, To watch her walks<SPLIT>, his hundred eyes applied<SPLIT>; And on the brims her sire<SPLIT>, the wat<SPLIT>'ry god<SPLIT>, Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>cloud of foot succeeds<SPLIT>, and fills the fields With swords<SPLIT>, and pointed spears<SPLIT>, and clatt<SPLIT>'ring shields<SPLIT>; Of Argives<SPLIT>, and of old Sicanian bands<SPLIT>, And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands<SPLIT>; Auruncan youth<SPLIT>, and those Sacrana yields<SPLIT>, And the proud Labicans<SPLIT>, with painted shields<SPLIT>, And those who near Numician streams reside<SPLIT>, And those whom Tiber<SPLIT>'s holy forests hide<SPLIT>, Or Circe<SPLIT>'s hills from the main land divide<SPLIT>; Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands<SPLIT>, Or the black water of Pomptina stands<SPLIT>.
Last<SPLIT>, from the Volscians fair Camilla came<SPLIT>, And led her warlike troops<SPLIT>, a warrior dame<SPLIT>; Unbred to spinning<SPLIT>, in the loom unskill'd<SPLIT>, She chose the nobler Pallas of the field<SPLIT>. Mix'd with the first<SPLIT>, the fierce virago fought<SPLIT>, Sustain'd the toils of arms<SPLIT>, the danger sought<SPLIT>, Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain<SPLIT>, Flew o<SPLIT>'er the fields<SPLIT>, nor hurt the bearded grain<SPLIT>: She swept the seas<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, as she skimm'd along<SPLIT>, Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung<SPLIT>. Men<SPLIT>, boys<SPLIT>, and women<SPLIT>, stupid with surprise<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>'er she passes<SPLIT>, fix their wond<SPLIT>'ring eyes<SPLIT>: Longing they look<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, gaping at the sight<SPLIT>, Devour her o<SPLIT>'er and o<SPLIT>'er with vast delight<SPLIT>; Her purple habit sits with such a grace On her smooth shoulders<SPLIT>, and so suits her face<SPLIT>; Her head with ringlets of her hair is crown'd<SPLIT>, And in a golden caul the curls are bound<SPLIT>. She shakes her myrtle jav'lin<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, behind<SPLIT>, Her Lycian quiver dances in the wind<SPLIT>.

BOOK VIII
When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs<SPLIT>, His standard planted on Laurentum<SPLIT>'s tow'rs<SPLIT>; When now the sprightly trumpet<SPLIT>, from afar<SPLIT>, Had giv'n the signal of approaching war<SPLIT>, Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields<SPLIT>, While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields<SPLIT>; Trembling with rage<SPLIT>, the Latian youth prepare To join th<SPLIT>' allies<SPLIT>, and headlong rush to war<SPLIT>. Fierce Ufens<SPLIT>, and Messapus<SPLIT>, led the crowd<SPLIT>, With bold Mezentius<SPLIT>, who blasphem'd aloud<SPLIT>. These thro<SPLIT>' the country took their wasteful course<SPLIT>, The fields to forage<SPLIT>, and to gather force<SPLIT>. Then Venulus to Diomede they send<SPLIT>, To beg his aid Ausonia to defend<SPLIT>, Declare the common danger<SPLIT>, and inform The Grecian leader of the growing storm<SPLIT>: Aeneas<SPLIT>, landed on the Latian coast<SPLIT>, With banish'd gods<SPLIT>, and with a baffled host<SPLIT>, Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state<SPLIT>, And claim'd a title from the gods and fate<SPLIT>; What num<SPLIT>'rous nations in his quarrel came<SPLIT>, And how they spread his formidable name<SPLIT>. What he design'd<SPLIT>, what mischief might arise<SPLIT>, If fortune favor'd his first enterprise<SPLIT>, Was left for him to weigh<SPLIT>, whose equal fears<SPLIT>, And common interest<SPLIT>, was involv'd in theirs<SPLIT>.
While Turnus and th<SPLIT>' allies thus urge the war<SPLIT>, The Trojan<SPLIT>, floating in a flood of care<SPLIT>, Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare<SPLIT>. This way and that he turns his anxious mind<SPLIT>; Thinks<SPLIT>, and rejects the counsels he design'd<SPLIT>; Explores himself in vain<SPLIT>, in ev'ry part<SPLIT>, And gives no rest to his distracted heart<SPLIT>. So<SPLIT>, when the sun by day<SPLIT>, or moon by night<SPLIT>, Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light<SPLIT>, The glitt<SPLIT>'ring species here and there divide<SPLIT>, And cast their dubious beams from side to side<SPLIT>; Now on the walls<SPLIT>, now on the pavement play<SPLIT>, And to the ceiling flash the glaring day<SPLIT>.
'<SPLIT>T was night<SPLIT>; and weary nature lull'd asleep The birds of air<SPLIT>, and fishes of the deep<SPLIT>, And beasts<SPLIT>, and mortal men<SPLIT>. The Trojan chief Was laid on Tiber<SPLIT>'s banks<SPLIT>, oppress'd with grief<SPLIT>, And found in silent slumber late relief<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' the shadows of the poplar wood<SPLIT>, Arose the father of the Roman flood<SPLIT>; An azure robe was o<SPLIT>'er his body spread<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head<SPLIT>: Thus<SPLIT>, manifest to sight<SPLIT>, the god appear'd<SPLIT>, And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Undoubted offspring of ethereal race<SPLIT>, O<SPLIT>long expected in this promis'd place<SPLIT>! Who thro<SPLIT>' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods<SPLIT>, Restor'd them to their hearths<SPLIT>, and old abodes<SPLIT>; This is thy happy home<SPLIT>, the clime where fate Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state<SPLIT>. Fear not<SPLIT>! The war shall end in lasting peace<SPLIT>, And all the rage of haughty Juno cease<SPLIT>. And that this nightly vision may not seem Th' effect of fancy<SPLIT>, or an idle dream<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>sow beneath an oak shall lie along<SPLIT>, All white herself<SPLIT>, and white her thirty young<SPLIT>. When thirty rolling years have run their race<SPLIT>, Thy son Ascanius<SPLIT>, on this empty space<SPLIT>, Shall build a royal town<SPLIT>, of lasting fame<SPLIT>, Which from this omen shall receive the name<SPLIT>. Time shall approve the truth<SPLIT>. For what remains<SPLIT>, And how with sure success to crown thy pains<SPLIT>, With patience next attend<SPLIT>. A banish'd band<SPLIT>, Driv'n with Evander from th<SPLIT>' Arcadian land<SPLIT>, Have planted here<SPLIT>, and plac'd on high their walls<SPLIT>; Their town the founder Pallanteum calls<SPLIT>, Deriv'd from Pallas<SPLIT>, his great-grandsire<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>: But the fierce Latians old possession claim<SPLIT>, With war infesting the new colony<SPLIT>. These make thy friends<SPLIT>, and on their aid rely<SPLIT>. To thy free passage I submit my streams<SPLIT>. Wake<SPLIT>, son of Venus<SPLIT>, from thy pleasing dreams<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, when the setting stars are lost in day<SPLIT>, To Juno<SPLIT>'s pow'r thy just devotion pay<SPLIT>; With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease<SPLIT>: Her pride at length shall fall<SPLIT>, her fury cease<SPLIT>. When thou return<SPLIT>'st victorious from the war<SPLIT>, Perform thy vows to me with grateful care<SPLIT>. The god am I<SPLIT>, whose yellow water flows Around these fields<SPLIT>, and fattens as it goes<SPLIT>: Tiber my name<SPLIT>; among the rolling floods Renown'd on earth<SPLIT>, esteem'd among the gods<SPLIT>. This is my certain seat<SPLIT>. In times to come<SPLIT>, My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>, and plung'd below<SPLIT>. While yet he spoke<SPLIT>, His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook<SPLIT>. He rose<SPLIT>, and looking up<SPLIT>, beheld the skies With purple blushing<SPLIT>, and the day arise<SPLIT>. Then water in his hollow palm he took From Tiber<SPLIT>'s flood<SPLIT>, and thus the pow'rs bespoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Laurentian nymphs<SPLIT>, by whom the streams are fed<SPLIT>, And Father Tiber<SPLIT>, in thy sacred bed Receive Aeneas<SPLIT>, and from danger keep. Whatever fount<SPLIT>, whatever holy deep<SPLIT>, Conceals thy wat<SPLIT>'ry stores<SPLIT>; where<SPLIT>'er they rise<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, bubbling from below<SPLIT>, salute the skies<SPLIT>; Thou<SPLIT>, king of horned floods<SPLIT>, whose plenteous urn Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn<SPLIT>, For this thy kind compassion of our woes<SPLIT>, Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, O be present to thy people<SPLIT>'s aid<SPLIT>, And firm the gracious promise thou hast made<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Thus having said<SPLIT>, two galleys from his stores<SPLIT>, With care he chooses<SPLIT>, mans<SPLIT>, and fits with oars<SPLIT>. Now on the shore the fatal swine is found<SPLIT>. Wondrous to tell!<SPLIT>- She lay along the ground<SPLIT>: Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung<SPLIT>; She white herself<SPLIT>, and white her thirty young<SPLIT>. Aeneas takes the mother and her brood<SPLIT>, And all on Juno<SPLIT>'s altar are bestow'd<SPLIT>.
The foll<SPLIT>'wing night<SPLIT>, and the succeeding day<SPLIT>, Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat<SPLIT>'ry way<SPLIT>: He roll'd his river back<SPLIT>, and pois'd he stood<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>gentle swelling<SPLIT>, and a peaceful flood<SPLIT>. The Trojans mount their ships<SPLIT>; they put from shore<SPLIT>, Borne on the waves<SPLIT>, and scarcely dip an oar<SPLIT>. Shouts from the land give omen to their course<SPLIT>, And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force<SPLIT>. The woods and waters wonder at the gleam Of shields<SPLIT>, and painted ships that stem the stream<SPLIT>. One summer<SPLIT>'s night and one whole day they pass Betwixt the greenwood shades<SPLIT>, and cut the liquid glass<SPLIT>. The fiery sun had finish'd half his race<SPLIT>, Look'd back<SPLIT>, and doubted in the middle space<SPLIT>, When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs<SPLIT>, The tops of sheds<SPLIT>, and shepherds<SPLIT>' lowly bow<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, Thin as they stood<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, then of homely clay<SPLIT>, Now rise in marble<SPLIT>, from the Roman sway<SPLIT>. These cots (<SPLIT>Evander<SPLIT>'s kingdom<SPLIT>, mean and poor<SPLIT>) The Trojan saw<SPLIT>, and turn'd his ships to shore<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T was on a solemn day<SPLIT>: th<SPLIT>' Arcadian states<SPLIT>, The king and prince<SPLIT>, without the city gates<SPLIT>, Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove To Hercules<SPLIT>, the warrior son of Jove<SPLIT>. Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies<SPLIT>, And fat of entrails on his altar fries<SPLIT>.
But<SPLIT>, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood<SPLIT>, And glitter'd thro<SPLIT>' the covert of the wood<SPLIT>, They rose with fear<SPLIT>, and left th<SPLIT>' unfinish'd feast<SPLIT>, Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest To pay the rites<SPLIT>. Himself without delay A<SPLIT>jav'lin seiz'd<SPLIT>, and singly took his way<SPLIT>; Then gain'd a rising ground<SPLIT>, and call'd from far<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Resolve me<SPLIT>, strangers<SPLIT>, whence<SPLIT>, and what you are<SPLIT>; Your bus'ness here<SPLIT>; and bring you peace or war<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" High on the stern Aeneas his stand<SPLIT>, And held a branch of olive in his hand<SPLIT>, While thus he spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The Phrygians<SPLIT>' arms you see<SPLIT>, Expell'd from Troy<SPLIT>, provok'd in Italy By Latian foes<SPLIT>, with war unjustly made<SPLIT>; At first affianc'd<SPLIT>, and at last betray'd<SPLIT>. This message bear<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>The Trojans and their chief Bring holy peace<SPLIT>, and beg the king<SPLIT>'s relief<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' Struck with so great a name<SPLIT>, and all on fire<SPLIT>, The youth replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Whatever you require<SPLIT>, Your fame exacts<SPLIT>. Upon our shores descend<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>welcome guest<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, what you wish<SPLIT>, a friend<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, downward hasting to the strand<SPLIT>, Embrac'd the stranger prince<SPLIT>, and join'd his hand<SPLIT>.
Conducted to the grove<SPLIT>, Aeneas broke The silence first<SPLIT>, and thus the king bespoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Best of the Greeks<SPLIT>, to whom<SPLIT>, by fate<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>bear these peaceful branches in my hand<SPLIT>, Undaunted I approach you<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' I know Your birth is Grecian<SPLIT>, and your land my foe<SPLIT>; From Atreus tho<SPLIT>' your ancient lineage came<SPLIT>, And both the brother kings your kindred claim<SPLIT>; Yet<SPLIT>, my self-conscious worth<SPLIT>, your high renown<SPLIT>, Your virtue<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' the neighb'ring nations blown<SPLIT>, Our fathers<SPLIT>' mingled blood<SPLIT>, Apollo<SPLIT>'s voice<SPLIT>, Have led me hither<SPLIT>, less by need than choice<SPLIT>. Our founder Dardanus<SPLIT>, as fame has sung<SPLIT>, And Greeks acknowledge<SPLIT>, from Electra sprung<SPLIT>: Electra from the loins of Atlas came<SPLIT>; Atlas<SPLIT>, whose head sustains the starry frame<SPLIT>. Your sire is Mercury<SPLIT>, whom long before On cold Cyllene<SPLIT>'s top fair Maia bore<SPLIT>. Maia the fair<SPLIT>, on fame if we rely<SPLIT>, Was Atlas<SPLIT>' daughter<SPLIT>, who sustains the sky<SPLIT>. Thus from one common source our streams divide<SPLIT>; Ours is the Trojan<SPLIT>, yours th<SPLIT>' Arcadian side<SPLIT>. Rais'd by these hopes<SPLIT>, I sent no news before<SPLIT>, Nor ask'd your leave<SPLIT>, nor did your faith implore<SPLIT>; But come<SPLIT>, without a pledge<SPLIT>, my own ambassador<SPLIT>. The same Rutulians<SPLIT>, who with arms pursue The Trojan race<SPLIT>, are equal foes to you<SPLIT>. Our host expell'd<SPLIT>, what farther force can stay The victor troops from universal sway<SPLIT>? Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land<SPLIT>, And either sea from side to side command<SPLIT>. Receive our offer'd faith<SPLIT>, and give us thine<SPLIT>; Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line<SPLIT>: We want not hearts nor bodies for the war<SPLIT>; In council cautious<SPLIT>, and in fields we dare<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>; and while spoke<SPLIT>, with piercing eyes Evander view'd the man with vast surprise<SPLIT>, Pleas'd with his action<SPLIT>, ravish'd with his face<SPLIT>: Then answer'd briefly<SPLIT>, with a royal grace<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O valiant leader of the Trojan line<SPLIT>, In whom the features of thy father shine<SPLIT>, How I recall Anchises<SPLIT>! how I see His motions<SPLIT>, mien<SPLIT>, and all my friend<SPLIT>, in thee<SPLIT>! Long tho<SPLIT>' it be<SPLIT>, 't is fresh within my mind<SPLIT>, When Priam to his sister<SPLIT>'s court design'd A<SPLIT>welcome visit<SPLIT>, with a friendly stay<SPLIT>, And thro<SPLIT>' th<SPLIT>' Arcadian kingdom took his way<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, past a boy<SPLIT>, the callow down began To shade my chin<SPLIT>, and call me first a man<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>saw the shining train with vast delight<SPLIT>, And Priam<SPLIT>'s goodly person pleas'd my sight<SPLIT>: But great Anchises<SPLIT>, far above the rest<SPLIT>, With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>long'd to join in friendship<SPLIT>'s holy bands Our mutual hearts<SPLIT>, and plight our mutual hands<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>first accosted him<SPLIT>: I sued<SPLIT>, I sought<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, with a loving force<SPLIT>, to Pheneus brought<SPLIT>. He gave me<SPLIT>, when at length constrain'd to go<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>vest embroider'd<SPLIT>, glorious to behold<SPLIT>, And two rich bridles<SPLIT>, with their bits of gold<SPLIT>, Which my son<SPLIT>'s coursers in obedience hold<SPLIT>. The league you ask<SPLIT>, I offer<SPLIT>, as your right<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, when to-morrow<SPLIT>'s sun reveals the light<SPLIT>, With swift supplies you shall be sent away<SPLIT>. Now celebrate with us this solemn day<SPLIT>, Whose holy rites admit no long delay<SPLIT>. Honor our annual feast<SPLIT>; and take your seat<SPLIT>, With friendly welcome<SPLIT>, at a homely treat<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus having said<SPLIT>, the bowls (<SPLIT>remov'd for fear<SPLIT>) The youths replac'd<SPLIT>, and soon restor'd the cheer<SPLIT>. On sods of turf he set the soldiers round<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>maple throne<SPLIT>, rais'd higher from the ground<SPLIT>, Receiv'd the Trojan chief<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'er the bed<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>lion<SPLIT>'s shaggy hide for ornament they spread<SPLIT>. The loaves were serv'd in canisters<SPLIT>; the wine In bowls<SPLIT>; the priest renew'd the rites divine<SPLIT>: Broil'd entrails are their food<SPLIT>, and beef<SPLIT>'s continued chine<SPLIT>.
But when the rage of hunger was repress'd<SPLIT>, Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>These rites<SPLIT>, these altars<SPLIT>, and this feast<SPLIT>, O king<SPLIT>, From no vain fears or superstition spring<SPLIT>, Or blind devotion<SPLIT>, or from blinder chance<SPLIT>, Or heady zeal<SPLIT>, or brutal ignorance<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, sav'd from danger<SPLIT>, with a grateful sense<SPLIT>, The labors of a god we recompense<SPLIT>. See<SPLIT>, from afar<SPLIT>, yon rock that mates the sky<SPLIT>, About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie<SPLIT>; Such indigested ruin<SPLIT>; bleak and bare<SPLIT>, How desart now it stands<SPLIT>, expos'd in air<SPLIT>! '<SPLIT>T was once a robber<SPLIT>'s den<SPLIT>, inclos'd around With living stone<SPLIT>, and deep beneath the ground<SPLIT>. The monster Cacus<SPLIT>, more than half a beast<SPLIT>, This hold<SPLIT>, impervious to the sun<SPLIT>, possess'd<SPLIT>. The pavement ever foul with human gore<SPLIT>; Heads<SPLIT>, and their mangled members<SPLIT>, hung the door<SPLIT>. Vulcan this plague begot<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, like his sire<SPLIT>, Black clouds he belch'd<SPLIT>, and flakes of livid fire<SPLIT>. Time<SPLIT>, long expected<SPLIT>, eas'd us of our load<SPLIT>, And brought the needful presence of a god<SPLIT>. Th' avenging force of Hercules<SPLIT>, from Spain<SPLIT>, Arriv'd in triumph<SPLIT>, from Geryon slain<SPLIT>: Thrice liv'd the giant<SPLIT>, and thrice liv'd in vain<SPLIT>.

"<SPLIT>Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place<SPLIT>, To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass<SPLIT>. The beasts<SPLIT>, who miss'd their mates<SPLIT>, fill'd all around With bellowings<SPLIT>, and the rocks restor'd the sound<SPLIT>. One heifer<SPLIT>, who had heard her love complain<SPLIT>, Roar'd from the cave<SPLIT>, and made the project vain<SPLIT>. Alcides found the fraud<SPLIT>; with rage he shook<SPLIT>, And toss'd about his head his knotted oak<SPLIT>. Swift as the winds<SPLIT>, or Scythian arrows<SPLIT>' flight<SPLIT>, He clomb<SPLIT>, with eager haste<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' aerial height<SPLIT>. Then first we saw the monster mend his pace<SPLIT>; Fear his eyes<SPLIT>, and paleness in his face<SPLIT>, Confess'd the god<SPLIT>'s approach<SPLIT>.

The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast<SPLIT>; The fierce avenger came with bounding haste<SPLIT>; Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold<SPLIT>, And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd<SPLIT>. He gnash'd his teeth<SPLIT>; and thrice he compass'd round With winged speed the circuit of the ground<SPLIT>.

The wond<SPLIT>'ring neighborhood<SPLIT>, with glad surprise<SPLIT>, Behold his shagged breast<SPLIT>, his giant size<SPLIT>, His mouth that flames no more<SPLIT>, and his extinguish'd eyes<SPLIT>. From that auspicious day<SPLIT>, with rites divine<SPLIT>, We worship at the hero<SPLIT>'s holy shrine<SPLIT>. Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows<SPLIT>: As priests<SPLIT>, were added the Pinarian house<SPLIT>, Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade<SPLIT>, Where honors<SPLIT>, ever due<SPLIT>, for ever shall be paid<SPLIT>. For these deserts<SPLIT>, and this high virtue shown<SPLIT>, Ye warlike youths<SPLIT>, your heads with garlands crown<SPLIT>: Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood<SPLIT>, And with deep draughts invoke our common god<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
This said<SPLIT>, a double wreath Evander twin'd<SPLIT>, And poplars black and white his temples bind<SPLIT>. Then brims his ample bowl<SPLIT>. With like design The rest invoke the gods<SPLIT>, with sprinkled wine<SPLIT>. Meantime the sun descended from the skies<SPLIT>, And the bright evening star began to rise<SPLIT>. And now the priests<SPLIT>, Potitius at their head<SPLIT>, In skins of beasts involv'd<SPLIT>, the long procession led<SPLIT>; Held high the flaming tapers in their hands<SPLIT>, As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands<SPLIT>; Then with a second course the tables load<SPLIT>, And with full chargers offer to the god<SPLIT>. The Salii sing<SPLIT>, and cense his altars round With Saban smoke<SPLIT>, their heads with poplar bound<SPLIT>- One choir of old<SPLIT>, another of the young<SPLIT>, To dance<SPLIT>, and bear the burthen of the song<SPLIT>. The lay records the labors<SPLIT>, and the praise<SPLIT>, And all th<SPLIT>' immortal acts of Hercules<SPLIT>: First<SPLIT>, how the mighty babe<SPLIT>, when swath'd in bands<SPLIT>, The serpents strangled with his infant hands<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, as in years and matchless force he grew<SPLIT>, Th' Oechalian walls<SPLIT>, and Trojan<SPLIT>, overthrew<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, a thousand hazards they relate<SPLIT>, Procur'd by Juno<SPLIT>'s and Eurystheus<SPLIT>' hate<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Thy hands<SPLIT>, unconquer'd hero<SPLIT>, could subdue The cloud-born Centaurs<SPLIT>, and the monster crew<SPLIT>: Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood<SPLIT>, Nor he<SPLIT>, the roaring terror of the wood<SPLIT>. The triple porter of the Stygian seat<SPLIT>, With lolling tongue<SPLIT>, lay fawning at thy feet<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, seiz'd with fear<SPLIT>, forgot his mangled meat<SPLIT>. Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight<SPLIT>; Thee<SPLIT>, god<SPLIT>, no face of danger could affright<SPLIT>; Not huge Typhoeus<SPLIT>, nor th<SPLIT>' unnumber'd snake<SPLIT>, Increas'd with hissing heads<SPLIT>, in Lerna<SPLIT>'s lake<SPLIT>. Hail<SPLIT>, Jove<SPLIT>'s undoubted son<SPLIT>! an added grace To heav'n and the great author of thy race<SPLIT>! Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay<SPLIT>, And smile propitious on thy solemn day<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" In numbers thus they sung<SPLIT>; above the rest<SPLIT>, The den and death of Cacus crown the feast<SPLIT>. The woods to hollow vales convey the sound<SPLIT>, The vales to hills<SPLIT>, and hills the notes rebound<SPLIT>. The rites perform'd<SPLIT>, the cheerful train retire<SPLIT>.
Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire<SPLIT>, The Trojan pass'd<SPLIT>, the city to survey<SPLIT>, And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way<SPLIT>. The stranger cast around his curious eyes<SPLIT>, New objects viewing still<SPLIT>, with new surprise<SPLIT>; With greedy joy enquires of various things<SPLIT>, And acts and monuments of ancient kings<SPLIT>. Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs<SPLIT>, Of Nymphs and Fauns<SPLIT>, and salvage men<SPLIT>, who took Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak<SPLIT>. Nor laws they knew<SPLIT>, nor manners<SPLIT>, nor the care Of lab'ring oxen<SPLIT>, or the shining share<SPLIT>, Nor arts of gain<SPLIT>, nor what they gain'd to spare<SPLIT>. Their exercise the chase<SPLIT>; the running flood Supplied their thirst<SPLIT>, the trees supplied their food<SPLIT>. Then Saturn came<SPLIT>, who fled the pow'r of Jove<SPLIT>, Robb'd of his realms<SPLIT>, and banish'd from above<SPLIT>. The men<SPLIT>, dispers'd on hills<SPLIT>, to towns he brought<SPLIT>, And laws ordain'd<SPLIT>, and civil customs taught<SPLIT>, And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay From his unduteous son<SPLIT>, and his usurping sway<SPLIT>. With his mild empire<SPLIT>, peace and plenty came<SPLIT>; And hence the golden times deriv'd their name<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>more degenerate and discolor'd age Succeeded this<SPLIT>, with avarice and rage<SPLIT>. Th' Ausonians then<SPLIT>, and bold Sicanians came<SPLIT>; And Saturn<SPLIT>'s empire often chang'd the name<SPLIT>. Then kings<SPLIT>, gigantic Tybris<SPLIT>, and the rest<SPLIT>, With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd<SPLIT>: For Tiber<SPLIT>'s flood was Albula before<SPLIT>, Till<SPLIT>, from the tyrant<SPLIT>'s fate<SPLIT>, his name it bore<SPLIT>.

Long toss'd on seas<SPLIT>, I sought this happy land<SPLIT>, Warn'd by my mother nymph<SPLIT>, and call'd by Heav'n<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus<SPLIT>, walking on<SPLIT>, he spoke<SPLIT>, and shew'd the gate<SPLIT>, Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state<SPLIT>; Where stood an altar<SPLIT>, sacred to the name Of old Carmenta<SPLIT>, the prophetic dame<SPLIT>, Who to her son foretold th<SPLIT>' Aenean race<SPLIT>, Sublime in fame<SPLIT>, and Rome<SPLIT>'s imperial place<SPLIT>: Then shews the forest<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, in after times<SPLIT>, Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes A<SPLIT>sacred refuge made<SPLIT>; with this<SPLIT>, the shrine Where Pan below the rock had rites divine<SPLIT>: Then tells of Argus<SPLIT>' death<SPLIT>, his murder'd guest<SPLIT>, Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest<SPLIT>.

Some god<SPLIT>, they knew<SPLIT>- what god<SPLIT>, they could not tell<SPLIT>- Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell<SPLIT>. Th' Arcadians thought him Jove<SPLIT>; and said they saw The mighty Thund<SPLIT>'rer with majestic awe<SPLIT>, Who took his shield<SPLIT>, and dealt his bolts around<SPLIT>, And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground<SPLIT>. Then saw two heaps of ruins<SPLIT>, (once they stood Two stately towns<SPLIT>, on either side the flood<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Saturnia<SPLIT>'s and Janicula<SPLIT>'s remains<SPLIT>; And either place the founder<SPLIT>'s name retains<SPLIT>. Discoursing thus together<SPLIT>, they resort Where poor Evander kept his country court<SPLIT>. They view'd the ground of Rome<SPLIT>'s litigious hall<SPLIT>; (<SPLIT>Once oxen low'd<SPLIT>, where now the lawyers bawl<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>) Then<SPLIT>, stooping<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' the narrow gate they press'd<SPLIT>, When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Mean as it is<SPLIT>, this palace<SPLIT>, and this door<SPLIT>, Receiv'd Alcides<SPLIT>, then a conqueror<SPLIT>.

Sacred to Vulcan<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>, an isle there lay<SPLIT>, Betwixt Sicilia<SPLIT>'s coasts and Lipare<SPLIT>, Rais'd high on smoking rocks<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, deep below<SPLIT>, In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow<SPLIT>. The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal<SPLIT>; Loud strokes<SPLIT>, and hissings of tormented steel<SPLIT>, Are heard around<SPLIT>; the boiling waters roar<SPLIT>, And smoky flames thro<SPLIT>' fuming tunnels soar<SPLIT>. Hether the Father of the Fire<SPLIT>, by night<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' the brown air precipitates his flight<SPLIT>. On their eternal anvils here he found The brethren beating<SPLIT>, and the blows go round<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>load of pointless thunder now there lies Before their hands<SPLIT>, to ripen for the skies<SPLIT>: These darts<SPLIT>, for angry Jove<SPLIT>, they daily cast<SPLIT>; Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste<SPLIT>. Three rays of writhen rain<SPLIT>, of fire three more<SPLIT>, Of winged southern winds and cloudy store As many parts<SPLIT>, the dreadful mixture frame<SPLIT>; And fears are added<SPLIT>, and avenging flame<SPLIT>. Inferior ministers<SPLIT>, for Mars<SPLIT>, repair His broken axletrees and blunted war<SPLIT>, And send him forth again with furbish'd arms<SPLIT>, To wake the lazy war with trumpets<SPLIT>' loud alarms<SPLIT>. The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold The shield of Pallas<SPLIT>, and renew their gold<SPLIT>. Full on the crest the Gorgon<SPLIT>'s head they place<SPLIT>, With eyes that roll in death<SPLIT>, and with distorted face<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>My sons<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said Vulcan<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>set your tasks aside<SPLIT>; Your strength and master-skill must now be tried<SPLIT>. Arms for a hero forge<SPLIT>; arms that require Your force<SPLIT>, your speed<SPLIT>, and all your forming fire<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>.

A<SPLIT>flood of molten silver<SPLIT>, brass<SPLIT>, and gold<SPLIT>, And deadly steel<SPLIT>, in the large furnace roll'd<SPLIT>; Of this<SPLIT>, their artful hands a shield prepare<SPLIT>, Alone sufficient to sustain the war<SPLIT>.

While<SPLIT>, at the Lemnian god<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>, they urge Their labors thus<SPLIT>, and ply th<SPLIT>' Aeolian forge<SPLIT>, The cheerful morn salutes Evander<SPLIT>'s eyes<SPLIT>, And songs of chirping birds invite to rise<SPLIT>. He leaves his lowly bed<SPLIT>: his buskins meet Above his ankles<SPLIT>; sandals sheathe his feet<SPLIT>: He sets his trusty sword upon his side<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er his shoulder throws a panther<SPLIT>'s hide<SPLIT>. Two menial dogs before their master press'd<SPLIT>. Thus clad<SPLIT>, and guarded thus<SPLIT>, he seeks his kingly guest<SPLIT>. Mindful of promis'd aid<SPLIT>, he mends his pace<SPLIT>, But meets Aeneas in the middle space<SPLIT>. Young Pallas did his father<SPLIT>'s steps attend<SPLIT>, And true Achates waited on his friend<SPLIT>.

But mighty nations I prepare<SPLIT>, to join Their arms with yours<SPLIT>, and aid your just design<SPLIT>. You come<SPLIT>, as by your better genius sent<SPLIT>, And fortune seems to favor your intent<SPLIT>. Not far from hence there stands a hilly town<SPLIT>, Of ancient building<SPLIT>, and of high renown<SPLIT>, Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race<SPLIT>, Who gave the name of Caere to the place<SPLIT>, Once Agyllina call'd<SPLIT>.

He cleaves the crowd<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, favor'd by the night<SPLIT>, To Turnus<SPLIT>' friendly court directs his flight<SPLIT>. By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire<SPLIT>, With arms<SPLIT>, their king to punishment require<SPLIT>: Their num<SPLIT>'rous troops<SPLIT>, now muster'd on the strand<SPLIT>, My counsel shall submit to your command<SPLIT>. Their navy swarms upon the coasts<SPLIT>; they cry To hoist their anchors<SPLIT>, but the gods deny<SPLIT>. An ancient augur<SPLIT>, skill'd in future fate<SPLIT>, With these foreboding words restrains their hate<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Ye brave in arms<SPLIT>, ye Lydian blood<SPLIT>, the flow<SPLIT>'r Of Tuscan youth<SPLIT>, and choice of all their pow'r<SPLIT>, Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms<SPLIT>, To seek your tyrant<SPLIT>'s death by lawful arms<SPLIT>; Know this<SPLIT>: no native of our land may lead This pow'rful people<SPLIT>; seek a foreign head<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' Aw'd with these words<SPLIT>, in camps they still abide<SPLIT>, And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide<SPLIT>.

Scarce had he said<SPLIT>; Achates and his guest<SPLIT>, With downcast eyes<SPLIT>, their silent grief express'd<SPLIT>; Who<SPLIT>, short of succors<SPLIT>, and in deep despair<SPLIT>, Shook at the dismal prospect of the war<SPLIT>. But his bright mother<SPLIT>, from a breaking cloud<SPLIT>, To cheer her issue<SPLIT>, thunder'd thrice aloud<SPLIT>; Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky<SPLIT>, And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, gazing up<SPLIT>, repeated peals they hear<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, in a heav'n serene<SPLIT>, refulgent arms appear<SPLIT>: Redd<SPLIT>'ning the skies<SPLIT>, and glitt<SPLIT>'ring all around<SPLIT>, The temper'd metals clash<SPLIT>, and yield a silver sound<SPLIT>.

He said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, rising from his homely throne<SPLIT>, The solemn rites of Hercules begun<SPLIT>, And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires<SPLIT>; Then cheerful to his household gods retires<SPLIT>; There offers chosen sheep.

Down with the falling stream the refuse run<SPLIT>, To raise with joyful news his drooping son<SPLIT>. Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band<SPLIT>, Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>sprightly courser<SPLIT>, fairer than the rest<SPLIT>, The king himself presents his royal guest<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>lion<SPLIT>'s hide his back and limbs infold<SPLIT>, Precious with studded work<SPLIT>, and paws of gold<SPLIT>.

Then old Evander<SPLIT>, with a close embrace<SPLIT>, Strain'd his departing friend<SPLIT>; and tears o<SPLIT>'erflow his face<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Would Heav'n<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "my strength and youth recall<SPLIT>, Such as I was beneath Praeneste<SPLIT>'s wall<SPLIT>; Then when I made the foremost foes retire<SPLIT>, And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire<SPLIT>; When Herilus in single fight I slew<SPLIT>, Whom with three lives Feronia did endue<SPLIT>; And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore<SPLIT>, Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more<SPLIT>- Such if I stood renew'd<SPLIT>, not these alarms<SPLIT>, Nor death<SPLIT>, should rend me from my Pallas<SPLIT>' arms<SPLIT>; Nor proud Mezentius<SPLIT>, thus unpunish'd<SPLIT>, boast His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast<SPLIT>.

His servants bore him off<SPLIT>, and softly laid His languish'd limbs upon his homely bed<SPLIT>.
The horsemen march<SPLIT>; the gates are open'd wide<SPLIT>; Aeneas at their head<SPLIT>, Achates by his side<SPLIT>.

Young Pallas shone conspicuous o<SPLIT>'er the rest<SPLIT>; Gilded his arms<SPLIT>, embroider'd was his vest<SPLIT>. So<SPLIT>, from the seas<SPLIT>, exerts his radiant head The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led<SPLIT>; Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews<SPLIT>, Dispels the darkness<SPLIT>, and the day renews<SPLIT>.

The troops<SPLIT>, drawn up in beautiful array<SPLIT>, O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way<SPLIT>. Repeated peals of shouts are heard around<SPLIT>; The neighing coursers answer to the sound<SPLIT>, And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground<SPLIT>.
A<SPLIT>greenwood shade<SPLIT>, for long religion known<SPLIT>, Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town<SPLIT>, Incompass'd round with gloomy hills above<SPLIT>, Which add a holy horror to the grove<SPLIT>. The first inhabitants of Grecian blood<SPLIT>, That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd<SPLIT>, The guardian of their flocks and fields<SPLIT>; and pay Their due devotions on his annual day<SPLIT>. Not far from hence<SPLIT>, along the river<SPLIT>'s side<SPLIT>, In tents secure<SPLIT>, the Tuscan troops abide<SPLIT>, By Tarchon led<SPLIT>.

Meantime the mother goddess<SPLIT>, crown'd with charms<SPLIT>, Breaks thro<SPLIT>' the clouds<SPLIT>, and brings the fated arms<SPLIT>.

He shakes the pointed spear<SPLIT>, and longs to try The plated cuishes on his manly thigh<SPLIT>; But most admires the shield<SPLIT>'s mysterious mold<SPLIT>, And Roman triumphs rising on the gold<SPLIT>: For these<SPLIT>, emboss'd<SPLIT>, the heav'nly smith had wrought (<SPLIT>Not in the rolls of future fate untaught<SPLIT>) The wars in order<SPLIT>, and the race divine Of warriors issuing from the Julian line<SPLIT>. The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens<SPLIT>: There<SPLIT>, by the wolf<SPLIT>, were laid the martial twins<SPLIT>.

Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea<SPLIT>; But foaming surges there in silver play<SPLIT>.

BOOK IX
While these affairs in distant places pass'd<SPLIT>, The various Iris Juno sends with haste<SPLIT>, To find bold Turnus<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, with anxious thought<SPLIT>, The secret shade of his great grandsire sought<SPLIT>. Retir'd alone she found the daring man<SPLIT>, And op'd her rosy lips<SPLIT>, and thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What none of all the gods could grant thy vows<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, Turnus<SPLIT>, this auspicious day bestows<SPLIT>. Aeneas<SPLIT>, gone to seek th<SPLIT>' Arcadian prince<SPLIT>, Has left the Trojan camp without defense<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, short of succors there<SPLIT>, employs his pains In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains<SPLIT>. Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs<SPLIT>; Unite thy forces<SPLIT>, and attack their lines<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This said<SPLIT>, on equal wings she pois'd her weight<SPLIT>, And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight<SPLIT>.
The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes<SPLIT>, And thus invokes the goddess as she flies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Iris<SPLIT>, the grace of heav'n<SPLIT>, what pow'r divine Has sent thee down<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' dusky clouds to shine<SPLIT>? See<SPLIT>, they divide<SPLIT>; immortal day appears<SPLIT>, And glitt<SPLIT>'ring planets dancing in their spheres<SPLIT>! With joy<SPLIT>, these happy omens I obey<SPLIT>, And follow to the war the god that leads the way<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus having said<SPLIT>, as by the brook he stood<SPLIT>, He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood<SPLIT>; Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws<SPLIT>, And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows<SPLIT>.
Now march the bold confed<SPLIT>'rates thro<SPLIT>' the plain<SPLIT>, Well hors'd<SPLIT>, well clad<SPLIT>; a rich and shining train<SPLIT>. Messapus leads the van<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, in the rear<SPLIT>, The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear<SPLIT>. In the main battle<SPLIT>, with his flaming crest<SPLIT>, The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest<SPLIT>. Silent they move<SPLIT>, majestically slow<SPLIT>, Like ebbing Nile<SPLIT>, or Ganges in his flow<SPLIT>. The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far<SPLIT>, And the dark menace of the distant war<SPLIT>. Caicus from the rampire saw it rise<SPLIT>, Black<SPLIT>'ning the fields<SPLIT>, and thick<SPLIT>'ning thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>. Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What rolling clouds<SPLIT>, my friends<SPLIT>, approach the walls<SPLIT>? Arm<SPLIT>! arm<SPLIT>! and man the works<SPLIT>! prepare your spears And pointed darts<SPLIT>! the Latian host appears<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus war<SPLIT>n'd<SPLIT>, they shut their gates<SPLIT>; with shouts ascend The bulwarks<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, secure<SPLIT>, their foes attend<SPLIT>: For their wise gen'ral<SPLIT>, with foreseeing care<SPLIT>, Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war<SPLIT>, Nor<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' provok'd<SPLIT>, in open fields advance<SPLIT>, But close within their lines attend their chance<SPLIT>. Unwilling<SPLIT>, yet they keep the strict command<SPLIT>, And sourly wait in arms the hostile band<SPLIT>. The fiery Turnus flew before the rest<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd<SPLIT>; His helm of massy gold<SPLIT>, and crimson was his crest<SPLIT>. With twenty horse to second his designs<SPLIT>, An unexpected foe<SPLIT>, he fac'd the lines<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Is there<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he said<SPLIT>, "in arms<SPLIT>, who bravely dare His leader<SPLIT>'s honor and his danger share<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" Then spurring on<SPLIT>, his brandish'd dart he threw<SPLIT>, In sign of war<SPLIT>: applauding shouts ensue<SPLIT>.
Amaz'd to find a dastard race<SPLIT>, that run Behind the rampires and the battle shun<SPLIT>, He rides around the camp<SPLIT>, with rolling eyes<SPLIT>, And stops at ev'ry post<SPLIT>, and ev'ry passage tries<SPLIT>. So roams the nightly wolf about the fold<SPLIT>: Wet with descending show<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, and stiff with cold<SPLIT>, He howls for hunger<SPLIT>, and he grins for pain<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) And<SPLIT>, impotent of anger<SPLIT>, finds no way In his distended paws to grasp the prey<SPLIT>. The mothers listen<SPLIT>; but the bleating lambs Securely swig the dug<SPLIT>, beneath the dams<SPLIT>. Thus ranges eager Turnus o<SPLIT>'er the plain<SPLIT>. Sharp with desire<SPLIT>, and furious with disdain<SPLIT>; Surveys each passage with a piercing sight<SPLIT>, To force his foes in equal field to fight<SPLIT>. Thus while he gazes round<SPLIT>, at length he spies<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>, fenc'd with strong redoubts<SPLIT>, their navy lies<SPLIT>, Close underneath the walls<SPLIT>; the washing tide Secures from all approach this weaker side<SPLIT>. He takes the wish'd occasion<SPLIT>, fills his hand With ready fires<SPLIT>, and shakes a flaming brand<SPLIT>. Urg'd by his presence<SPLIT>, ev'ry soul is warm'd<SPLIT>, And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd<SPLIT>. From the fir'd pines the scatt<SPLIT>'ring sparkles fly<SPLIT>; Fat vapors<SPLIT>, mix'd with flames<SPLIT>, involve the sky<SPLIT>. What pow'r<SPLIT>, O Muses<SPLIT>, could avert the flame Which threaten'd<SPLIT>, in the fleet<SPLIT>, the Trojan name<SPLIT>? Tell<SPLIT>: for the fact<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' length of time obscure<SPLIT>, Is hard to faith<SPLIT>; yet shall the fame endure<SPLIT>.
'<SPLIT>T is said that<SPLIT>, when the chief prepar'd his flight<SPLIT>, And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida<SPLIT>'s height<SPLIT>, The grandam goddess then approach'd her son<SPLIT>, And with a mother<SPLIT>'s majesty begun<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Grant me<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>the sole request I bring<SPLIT>, Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king<SPLIT>. On Ida<SPLIT>'s brows<SPLIT>, for ages past<SPLIT>, there stood<SPLIT>, With firs and maples fill'd<SPLIT>, a shady wood<SPLIT>; And on the summit rose a sacred grove<SPLIT>, Where I was worship'd with religious love<SPLIT>. Those woods<SPLIT>, that holy grove<SPLIT>, my long delight<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>gave the Trojan prince<SPLIT>, to speed his flight<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, fill'd with fear<SPLIT>, on their behalf I come<SPLIT>; Let neither winds o<SPLIT>'erset<SPLIT>, nor waves intomb The floating forests of the sacred pine<SPLIT>; But let it be their safety to be mine<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then thus replied her awful son<SPLIT>, who rolls The radiant stars<SPLIT>, and heav'n and earth controls<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>How dare you<SPLIT>, mother<SPLIT>, endless date demand For vessels molded by a mortal hand<SPLIT>? What then is fate<SPLIT>? Shall bold Aeneas ride<SPLIT>, Of safety certain<SPLIT>, on th<SPLIT>' uncertain tide<SPLIT>? Yet<SPLIT>, what I can<SPLIT>, I grant<SPLIT>; when<SPLIT>, wafted o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, The chief is landed on the Latian shore<SPLIT>, Whatever ships escape the raging storms<SPLIT>, At my command shall change their fading forms To nymphs divine<SPLIT>, and plow the wat<SPLIT>'ry way<SPLIT>, Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" To seal his sacred vow<SPLIT>, by Styx he swore<SPLIT>, The lake of liquid pitch<SPLIT>, the dreary shore<SPLIT>, And Phlegethon<SPLIT>'s innavigable flood<SPLIT>, And the black regions of his brother god<SPLIT>. He said<SPLIT>; and shook the skies with his imperial nod<SPLIT>.
And now at length the number'd hours were come<SPLIT>, Prefix'd by fate<SPLIT>'s irrevocable doom<SPLIT>, When the great Mother of the Gods was free To save her ships<SPLIT>, and finish Jove<SPLIT>'s decree<SPLIT>. First<SPLIT>, from the quarter of the morn<SPLIT>, there sprung A<SPLIT>light that sign'd the heav'ns<SPLIT>, and shot along<SPLIT>; Then from a cloud<SPLIT>, fring'd round with golden fires<SPLIT>, Were timbrels heard<SPLIT>, and Berecynthian choirs<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, last<SPLIT>, a voice<SPLIT>, with more than mortal sounds<SPLIT>, Both hosts<SPLIT>, in arms oppos'd<SPLIT>, with equal horror wounds<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O Trojan race<SPLIT>, your needless aid forbear<SPLIT>, And know<SPLIT>, my ships are my peculiar care<SPLIT>. With greater ease the bold Rutulian may<SPLIT>, With hissing brands<SPLIT>, attempt to burn the sea<SPLIT>, Than singe my sacred pines<SPLIT>. But you<SPLIT>, my charge<SPLIT>, Loos'd from your crooked anchors<SPLIT>, launch at large<SPLIT>, Exalted each a nymph<SPLIT>: forsake the sand<SPLIT>, And swim the seas<SPLIT>, at Cybele<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak<SPLIT>, When<SPLIT>, lo! th<SPLIT>' obedient ships their haulsers break<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, strange to tell<SPLIT>, like dolphins<SPLIT>, in the main They plunge their prows<SPLIT>, and dive<SPLIT>, and spring again<SPLIT>: As many beauteous maids the billows sweep<SPLIT>, As rode before tall vessels on the deep<SPLIT>.
The foes<SPLIT>, surpris'd with wonder<SPLIT>, stood aghast<SPLIT>; Messapus curb'd his fiery courser<SPLIT>'s haste<SPLIT>; Old Tiber roar'd<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, raising up his head<SPLIT>, Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed<SPLIT>. Turnus alone<SPLIT>, undaunted<SPLIT>, bore the shock<SPLIT>, And with these words his trembling troops bespoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>These monsters for the Trojans<SPLIT>' fate are meant<SPLIT>, And are by Jove for black presages sent<SPLIT>. He takes the cowards<SPLIT>' last relief away<SPLIT>; For fly they cannot<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, constrain'd to stay<SPLIT>, Must yield unfought<SPLIT>, a base inglorious prey<SPLIT>. The liquid half of all the globe is lost<SPLIT>; Heav'n shuts the seas<SPLIT>, and we secure the coast<SPLIT>. Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground Which myriads of our martial men surround<SPLIT>. Their fates I fear not<SPLIT>, or vain oracles<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas<SPLIT>, And land secure upon the Latian plains<SPLIT>: Their promis'd hour is pass'd<SPLIT>, and mine remains<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy<SPLIT>, With sword and fire<SPLIT>, the faithless race of Troy<SPLIT>. Shall such affronts as these alone inflame The Grecian brothers<SPLIT>, and the Grecian name<SPLIT>? My cause and theirs is one<SPLIT>; a fatal strife<SPLIT>, And final ruin<SPLIT>, for a ravish'd wife<SPLIT>. Was 't not enough<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, punish'd for the crime<SPLIT>, They fell<SPLIT>; but will they fall a second time<SPLIT>? One would have thought they paid enough before<SPLIT>, To curse the costly sex<SPLIT>, and durst offend no more<SPLIT>. Can they securely trust their feeble wall<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>slight partition<SPLIT>, a thin interval<SPLIT>, Betwixt their fate and them<SPLIT>; when Troy<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' built By hands divine<SPLIT>, yet perish'd by their guilt<SPLIT>? Lend me<SPLIT>, for once<SPLIT>, my friends<SPLIT>, your valiant hands<SPLIT>, To force from out their lines these dastard bands<SPLIT>. Less than a thousand ships will end this war<SPLIT>, Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare<SPLIT>. Let all the Tuscans<SPLIT>, all th<SPLIT>' Arcadians<SPLIT>, join<SPLIT>! Nor these<SPLIT>, nor those<SPLIT>, shall frustrate my design<SPLIT>. Let them not fear the treasons of the night<SPLIT>, The robb'd Palladium<SPLIT>, the pretended flight<SPLIT>: Our onset shall be made in open light<SPLIT>. No wooden engine shall their town betray<SPLIT>; Fires they shall have around<SPLIT>, but fires by day<SPLIT>. No Grecian babes before their camp appear<SPLIT>, Whom Hector<SPLIT>'s arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, since the sun is rolling to the west<SPLIT>, Give we the silent night to needful rest<SPLIT>: Refresh your bodies<SPLIT>, and your arms prepare<SPLIT>; The morn shall end the small remains of war<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
The post of honor to Messapus falls<SPLIT>, To keep the nightly guard<SPLIT>, to watch the walls<SPLIT>, To pitch the fires at distances around<SPLIT>, And close the Trojans in their scanty ground<SPLIT>. Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand<SPLIT>, And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command<SPLIT>; All clad in shining arms the works invest<SPLIT>, Each with a radiant helm and waving crest<SPLIT>. Stretch'd at their length<SPLIT>, they press the grassy ground<SPLIT>; They laugh<SPLIT>, they sing<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>the jolly bowls go round<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) With lights and cheerful fires renew the day<SPLIT>, And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play<SPLIT>.
The Trojans<SPLIT>, from above<SPLIT>, their foes beheld<SPLIT>, And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd<SPLIT>. Seiz'd with affright<SPLIT>, their gates they first explore<SPLIT>; Join works to works with bridges<SPLIT>, tow'r to tow'r<SPLIT>: Thus all things needful for defense abound<SPLIT>. Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round<SPLIT>, Commission'd by their absent prince to share The common danger<SPLIT>, and divide the care<SPLIT>. The soldiers draw their lots<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, as they fall<SPLIT>, By turns relieve each other on the wall<SPLIT>.
Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance<SPLIT>, To watch the gate was warlike Nisus<SPLIT>' chance<SPLIT>. His father Hyrtacus of noble blood<SPLIT>; His mother was a huntress of the wood<SPLIT>, And sent him to the wars<SPLIT>. Well could he bear His lance in fight<SPLIT>, and dart the flying spear<SPLIT>, But better skill'd unerring shafts to send<SPLIT>. Beside him stood Euryalus<SPLIT>, his friend<SPLIT>: Euryalus<SPLIT>, than whom the Trojan host No fairer face<SPLIT>, or sweeter air<SPLIT>, could boast- Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun<SPLIT>. One was their care<SPLIT>, and their delight was one<SPLIT>: One common hazard in the war they shar'd<SPLIT>, And now were both by choice upon the guard<SPLIT>.
Then Nisus thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Or do the gods inspire This warmth<SPLIT>, or make we gods of our desire<SPLIT>? A<SPLIT>gen'rous ardor boils within my breast<SPLIT>, Eager of action<SPLIT>, enemy to rest<SPLIT>: This urges me to fight<SPLIT>, and fires my mind To leave a memorable name behind<SPLIT>. Thou see<SPLIT>'st the foe secure<SPLIT>; how faintly shine Their scatter'd fires<SPLIT>! the most<SPLIT>, in sleep supine Along the ground<SPLIT>, an easy conquest lie<SPLIT>: The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply<SPLIT>; All hush'd around<SPLIT>. Now hear what I revolve- A<SPLIT>thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve<SPLIT>. Our absent prince both camp and council mourn<SPLIT>; By message both would hasten his return<SPLIT>: If they confer what I demand on thee<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>For fame is recompense enough for me<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Methinks<SPLIT>, beneath yon hill<SPLIT>, I have espied A<SPLIT>way that safely will my passage guide<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Euryalus stood list<SPLIT>'ning while he spoke<SPLIT>, With love of praise and noble envy struck<SPLIT>; Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>All this<SPLIT>, alone<SPLIT>, and leaving me behind<SPLIT>! Am I unworthy<SPLIT>, Nisus<SPLIT>, to be join'd<SPLIT>? Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield<SPLIT>, Or send thee unassisted to the field<SPLIT>? Not so my father taught my childhood arms<SPLIT>; Born in a siege<SPLIT>, and bred among alarms<SPLIT>! Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend<SPLIT>, Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend<SPLIT>. The thing call'd life<SPLIT>, with ease I can disclaim<SPLIT>, And think it over-sold to purchase fame<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Then Nisus thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Alas<SPLIT>! thy tender years Would minister new matter to my fears<SPLIT>. So may the gods<SPLIT>, who view this friendly strife<SPLIT>, Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life<SPLIT>, Condemn'd to pay my vows<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>as sure I trust<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) This thy request is cruel and unjust<SPLIT>. But if some chance<SPLIT>- as many chances are<SPLIT>, And doubtful hazards<SPLIT>, in the deeds of war- If one should reach my head<SPLIT>, there let it fall<SPLIT>, And spare thy life<SPLIT>; I would not perish all<SPLIT>. Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date<SPLIT>: Live thou to mourn thy love<SPLIT>'s unhappy fate<SPLIT>; To bear my mangled body from the foe<SPLIT>, Or buy it back<SPLIT>, and fun'ral rites bestow<SPLIT>. Or<SPLIT>, if hard fortune shall those dues deny<SPLIT>, Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>let not me the widow<SPLIT>'s tears renew<SPLIT>! Nor let a mother<SPLIT>'s curse my name pursue<SPLIT>: Thy pious parent<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, for love of thee<SPLIT>, Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily<SPLIT>, Her age committing to the seas and wind<SPLIT>, When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" To this<SPLIT>, Euryalus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>You plead in vain<SPLIT>, And but protract the cause you cannot gain<SPLIT>. No more delays<SPLIT>, but haste<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" With that<SPLIT>, he wakes The nodding watch<SPLIT>; each to his office takes<SPLIT>. The guard reliev'd<SPLIT>, the gen'rous couple went To find the council at the royal tent<SPLIT>.
All creatures else forgot their daily care<SPLIT>, And sleep<SPLIT>, the common gift of nature<SPLIT>, share<SPLIT>; Except the Trojan peers<SPLIT>, who wakeful sate In nightly council for th<SPLIT>' indanger'd state<SPLIT>. They vote a message to their absent chief<SPLIT>, Shew their distress<SPLIT>, and beg a swift relief<SPLIT>. Amid the camp a silent seat they chose<SPLIT>, Remote from clamor<SPLIT>, and secure from foes<SPLIT>. On their left arms their ample shields they bear<SPLIT>, The right reclin'd upon the bending spear<SPLIT>. Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard<SPLIT>, And beg admission<SPLIT>, eager to be heard<SPLIT>: Th' affair important<SPLIT>, not to be deferr'd<SPLIT>. Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in<SPLIT>, Ord<SPLIT>'ring the more experienc'd to begin<SPLIT>. Then Nisus thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Ye fathers<SPLIT>, lend your ears<SPLIT>; Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years<SPLIT>. The foe<SPLIT>, securely drench'd in sleep and wine<SPLIT>, Neglect their watch<SPLIT>; the fires but thinly shine<SPLIT>; And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies<SPLIT>, Cov'ring the plain<SPLIT>, and curling to the skies<SPLIT>, Betwixt two paths<SPLIT>, which at the gate divide<SPLIT>, Close by the sea<SPLIT>, a passage we have spied<SPLIT>, Which will our way to great Aeneas guide<SPLIT>. Expect each hour to see him safe again<SPLIT>, Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain<SPLIT>. Snatch we the lucky minute while we may<SPLIT>; Nor can we be mistaken in the way<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, hunting in the vale<SPLIT>, we both have seen The rising turrets<SPLIT>, and the stream between<SPLIT>, And know the winding course<SPLIT>, with ev'ry ford<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He ceas'd<SPLIT>; and old Alethes took the word<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Our country gods<SPLIT>, in whom our trust we place<SPLIT>, Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race<SPLIT>, While we behold such dauntless worth appear In dawning youth<SPLIT>, and souls so void of fear<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then into tears of joy the father broke<SPLIT>; Each in his longing arms by turns he took<SPLIT>; Panted and paus'd<SPLIT>; and thus again he spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Ye brave young men<SPLIT>, what equal gifts can we<SPLIT>, In recompense of such desert<SPLIT>, decree<SPLIT>? The greatest<SPLIT>, sure<SPLIT>, and best you can receive<SPLIT>, The gods and your own conscious worth will give<SPLIT>. The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow<SPLIT>, And young Ascanius till his manhood owe<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
"<SPLIT>And I<SPLIT>, whose welfare in my father lies<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" Ascanius adds<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>by the great deities<SPLIT>, By my dear country<SPLIT>, by my household gods<SPLIT>, By hoary Vesta<SPLIT>'s rites and dark abodes<SPLIT>, Adjure you both<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>on you my fortune stands<SPLIT>; That and my faith I plight into your hands<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Make me but happy in his safe return<SPLIT>, Whose wanted presence I can only mourn<SPLIT>; Your common gift shall two large goblets be Of silver<SPLIT>, wrought with curious imagery<SPLIT>, And high emboss'd<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, when old Priam reign'd<SPLIT>, My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd<SPLIT>; And more<SPLIT>, two tripods cast in antic mold<SPLIT>, With two great talents of the finest gold<SPLIT>; Beside a costly bowl<SPLIT>, ingrav'd with art<SPLIT>, Which Dido gave<SPLIT>, when first she gave her heart<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, if in conquer'd Italy we reign<SPLIT>, When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain- Thou saw<SPLIT>'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd<SPLIT>: That<SPLIT>, Nisus<SPLIT>, and his arms<SPLIT>, and nodding crest<SPLIT>, And shield<SPLIT>, from chance exempt<SPLIT>, shall be thy share<SPLIT>: Twelve lab'ring slaves<SPLIT>, twelve handmaids young and fair All clad in rich attire<SPLIT>, and train'd with care<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, last<SPLIT>, a Latian field with fruitful plains<SPLIT>, And a large portion of the king<SPLIT>'s domains<SPLIT>. But thou<SPLIT>, whose years are more to mine allied<SPLIT>- No fate my vow'd affection shall divide From thee<SPLIT>, heroic youth<SPLIT>! Be wholly mine<SPLIT>; Take full possession<SPLIT>; all my soul is thine<SPLIT>. One faith<SPLIT>, one fame<SPLIT>, one fate<SPLIT>, shall both attend<SPLIT>; My life<SPLIT>'s companion<SPLIT>, and my bosom friend<SPLIT>: My peace shall be committed to thy care<SPLIT>, And to thy conduct my concerns in war<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Then thus the young Euryalus replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Whatever fortune<SPLIT>, good or bad<SPLIT>, betide<SPLIT>, The same shall be my age<SPLIT>, as now my youth<SPLIT>; No time shall find me wanting to my truth<SPLIT>. This only from your goodness let me gain (<SPLIT>And<SPLIT>, this ungranted<SPLIT>, all rewards are vain<SPLIT>) Of Priam<SPLIT>'s royal race my mother came<SPLIT>- And sure the best that ever bore the name<SPLIT>- Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold From me departing<SPLIT>, but<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'erspent and old<SPLIT>, My fate she follow'd<SPLIT>. Ignorant of this (<SPLIT>Whatever<SPLIT>) danger<SPLIT>, neither parting kiss<SPLIT>, Nor pious blessing taken<SPLIT>, her I leave<SPLIT>, And in this only act of all my life deceive<SPLIT>. By this right hand and conscious Night I swear<SPLIT>, My soul so sad a farewell could not bear<SPLIT>. Be you her comfort<SPLIT>; fill my vacant place (<SPLIT>Permit me to presume so great a grace<SPLIT>) Support her age<SPLIT>, forsaken and distress'd<SPLIT>. That hope alone will fortify my breast Against the worst of fortunes<SPLIT>, and of fears<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>. The mov'd assistants melt in tears<SPLIT>.
Then thus Ascanius<SPLIT>, wonderstruck to see That image of his filial piety<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>So great beginnings<SPLIT>, in so green an age<SPLIT>, Exact the faith which I again ingage<SPLIT>. Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim<SPLIT>, Creusa had<SPLIT>, and only want the name<SPLIT>. Whate<SPLIT>'er event thy bold attempt shall have<SPLIT>, '<SPLIT>T is merit to have borne a son so brave<SPLIT>. Now by my head<SPLIT>, a sacred oath<SPLIT>, I swear<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>My father us'd it<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) what<SPLIT>, returning here Crown'd with success<SPLIT>, I for thyself prepare<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, if thou fail<SPLIT>, shall thy lov'd mother share<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>, and weeping<SPLIT>, while he spoke the word<SPLIT>, From his broad belt he drew a shining sword<SPLIT>, Magnificent with gold<SPLIT>. Lycaon made<SPLIT>, And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade<SPLIT>. This was his gift<SPLIT>. Great Mnestheus gave his friend A<SPLIT>lion<SPLIT>'s hide<SPLIT>, his body to defend<SPLIT>; And good Alethes furnish'd him<SPLIT>, beside<SPLIT>, With his own trusty helm<SPLIT>, of temper tried<SPLIT>.
Thus arm'd they went<SPLIT>. The noble Trojans wait Their issuing forth<SPLIT>, and follow to the gate With prayers and vows<SPLIT>. Above the rest appears Ascanius<SPLIT>, manly far beyond his years<SPLIT>, And messages committed to their care<SPLIT>, Which all in winds were lost<SPLIT>, and flitting air<SPLIT>.
The trenches first they pass'd<SPLIT>; then took their way Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay<SPLIT>; To many fatal<SPLIT>, ere themselves were slain<SPLIT>. They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, gorg'd<SPLIT>, and drunk with wine<SPLIT>, supinely snore<SPLIT>. Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore<SPLIT>: Amidst the wheels and reins<SPLIT>, the goblet by<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>medley of debauch and war<SPLIT>, they lie<SPLIT>. Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight<SPLIT>. Occasion offers<SPLIT>, and I stand prepar'd<SPLIT>; There lies our way<SPLIT>; be thou upon the guard<SPLIT>, And look around<SPLIT>, while I securely go<SPLIT>, And hew a passage thro<SPLIT>' the sleeping foe<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Softly he spoke<SPLIT>; then striding took his way<SPLIT>, With his drawn sword<SPLIT>, where haughty Rhamnes lay<SPLIT>; His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath<SPLIT>, And heaving from his breast<SPLIT>, he drew his breath<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>king and prophet<SPLIT>, by King Turnus lov'd<SPLIT>: But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd<SPLIT>. Him and his sleeping slaves he slew<SPLIT>; then spies Where Remus<SPLIT>, with his rich retinue<SPLIT>, lies<SPLIT>. His armor-bearer first<SPLIT>, and next he kills His charioteer<SPLIT>, intrench'd betwixt the wheels And his lov'd horses<SPLIT>; last invades their lord<SPLIT>; Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword<SPLIT>: The gasping head flies off<SPLIT>; a purple flood Flows from the trunk<SPLIT>, that welters in the blood<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, by the spurning heels dispers'd around<SPLIT>, The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground<SPLIT>. Lamus the bold<SPLIT>, and Lamyrus the strong<SPLIT>, He slew<SPLIT>, and then Serranus fair and young<SPLIT>. From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest<SPLIT>, And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast<SPLIT>: Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play- More lucky<SPLIT>, had it lasted till the day<SPLIT>. The famish'd lion thus<SPLIT>, with hunger bold<SPLIT>, O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold<SPLIT>, And tears the peaceful flocks<SPLIT>: with silent awe Trembling they lie<SPLIT>, and pant beneath his paw<SPLIT>.
Nor with less rage Euryalus employs The wrathful sword<SPLIT>, or fewer foes destroys<SPLIT>; But on th<SPLIT>' ignoble crowd his fury flew<SPLIT>; He Fadus<SPLIT>, Hebesus<SPLIT>, and Rhoetus slew<SPLIT>. Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell<SPLIT>, But Rhoetus wakeful<SPLIT>, and observing all<SPLIT>: Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear<SPLIT>; The fatal iron found and reach'd him there<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, as he rose<SPLIT>, it pierc'd his naked side<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, reeking<SPLIT>, thence return'd in crimson dyed<SPLIT>. The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood<SPLIT>; The purple soul comes floating in the flood<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, where Messapus quarter'd<SPLIT>, they arrive<SPLIT>. The fires were fainting there<SPLIT>, and just alive<SPLIT>; The warrior-horses<SPLIT>, tied in order<SPLIT>, fed<SPLIT>. Nisus observ'd the discipline<SPLIT>, and said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Our eager thirst of blood may both betray<SPLIT>; And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day<SPLIT>, Foe to nocturnal thefts<SPLIT>. No more<SPLIT>, my friend<SPLIT>; Here let our glutted execution end<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>lane thro<SPLIT>' slaughter'd bodies we have made<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The bold Euryalus<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' loth<SPLIT>, obey'd<SPLIT>. Of arms<SPLIT>, and arras<SPLIT>, and of plate<SPLIT>, they find A<SPLIT>precious load<SPLIT>; but these they leave behind<SPLIT>. Yet<SPLIT>, fond of gaudy spoils<SPLIT>, the boy would stay To make the rich caparison his prey<SPLIT>, Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay<SPLIT>. Nor did his eyes less longingly behold The girdle-belt<SPLIT>, with nails of burnish'd gold<SPLIT>. This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd On Remulus<SPLIT>, when friendship first they vow'd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, absent<SPLIT>, join'd in hospitable ties<SPLIT>: He<SPLIT>, dying<SPLIT>, to his heir bequeath'd the prize<SPLIT>; Till<SPLIT>, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd<SPLIT>, He fell<SPLIT>; and they the glorious gift possess'd<SPLIT>. These glitt<SPLIT>'ring spoils (<SPLIT>now made the victor<SPLIT>'s gain<SPLIT>) He to his body suits<SPLIT>, but suits in vain<SPLIT>: Messapus<SPLIT>' helm he finds among the rest<SPLIT>, And laces on<SPLIT>, and wears the waving crest<SPLIT>. Proud of their conquest<SPLIT>, prouder of their prey<SPLIT>, They leave the camp<SPLIT>, and take the ready way<SPLIT>.
But far they had not pass'd<SPLIT>, before they spied Three hundred horse<SPLIT>, with Volscens for their guide<SPLIT>. The queen a legion to King Turnus sent<SPLIT>; But the swift horse the slower foot prevent<SPLIT>, And now<SPLIT>, advancing<SPLIT>, sought the leader<SPLIT>'s tent<SPLIT>. They saw the pair<SPLIT>; for<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' the doubtful shade<SPLIT>, His shining helm Euryalus betray'd<SPLIT>, On which the moon with full reflection play'd<SPLIT>. "'T is not for naught<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" cried Volscens from the crowd<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>These men go there<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>" then rais'd his voice aloud<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Stand<SPLIT>! stand<SPLIT>! why thus in arms<SPLIT>? And whither bent<SPLIT>? From whence<SPLIT>, to whom<SPLIT>, and on what errand sent<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" Silent they scud away<SPLIT>, and haste their flight To neighb'ring woods<SPLIT>, and trust themselves to night<SPLIT>. The speedy horse all passages belay<SPLIT>, And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way<SPLIT>, And watch each entrance of the winding wood<SPLIT>. Black was the forest<SPLIT>: thick with beech it stood<SPLIT>, Horrid with fern<SPLIT>, and intricate with thorn<SPLIT>; Few paths of human feet<SPLIT>, or tracks of beasts<SPLIT>, were worn<SPLIT>. The darkness of the shades<SPLIT>, his heavy prey<SPLIT>, And fear<SPLIT>, misled the younger from his way<SPLIT>. But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, thoughtless of his friend<SPLIT>, the forest pass'd<SPLIT>, And Alban plains<SPLIT>, from Alba<SPLIT>'s name so call'd<SPLIT>, Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd<SPLIT>; Till<SPLIT>, turning at the length<SPLIT>, he stood his ground<SPLIT>, And miss'd his friend<SPLIT>, and cast his eyes around<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Ah wretch<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" he cried<SPLIT>, "where have I left behind Th' unhappy youth<SPLIT>? where shall I hope to find<SPLIT>? Or what way take<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" Again he ventures back<SPLIT>, And treads the mazes of his former track<SPLIT>. He winds the wood<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, list<SPLIT>'ning<SPLIT>, hears the noise Of tramping coursers<SPLIT>, and the riders<SPLIT>' voice<SPLIT>. The sound approach'd<SPLIT>; and suddenly he view'd The foes inclosing<SPLIT>, and his friend pursued<SPLIT>, Forelaid and taken<SPLIT>, while he strove in vain The shelter of the friendly shades to gain<SPLIT>. What should he next attempt<SPLIT>? what arms employ<SPLIT>, What fruitless force<SPLIT>, to free the captive boy<SPLIT>? Or desperate should he rush and lose his life<SPLIT>, With odds oppress'd<SPLIT>, in such unequal strife<SPLIT>?
Resolv'd at length<SPLIT>, his pointed spear he shook<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, casting on the moon a mournful look<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Guardian of groves<SPLIT>, and goddess of the night<SPLIT>, Fair queen<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he said<SPLIT>, "direct my dart aright<SPLIT>. If e<SPLIT>'er my pious father<SPLIT>, for my sake<SPLIT>, Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make<SPLIT>, Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils<SPLIT>, And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils<SPLIT>, Give me to scatter these<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then from his ear He pois'd<SPLIT>, and aim'd<SPLIT>, and launch'd the trembling spear<SPLIT>. The deadly weapon<SPLIT>, hissing from the grove<SPLIT>, Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove<SPLIT>; Pierc'd his thin armor<SPLIT>, drank his vital blood<SPLIT>, And in his body left the broken wood<SPLIT>. He staggers round<SPLIT>; his eyeballs roll in death<SPLIT>, And with short sobs he gasps away his breath<SPLIT>. All stand amaz'd<SPLIT>- a second jav'lin flies With equal strength<SPLIT>, and quivers thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>. This thro<SPLIT>' thy temples<SPLIT>, Tagus<SPLIT>, forc'd the way<SPLIT>, And in the brainpan warmly buried lay<SPLIT>. Fierce Volscens foams with rage<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, gazing round<SPLIT>, Descried not him who gave the fatal wound<SPLIT>, Nor knew to fix revenge<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>But thou<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he cries<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>Shalt pay for both<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" and at the pris'ner flies With his drawn sword<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, struck with deep despair<SPLIT>, That cruel sight the lover could not bear<SPLIT>; But from his covert rush'd in open view<SPLIT>, And sent his voice before him as he flew<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Me<SPLIT>! me<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" he cried<SPLIT>- "turn all your swords alone On me- the fact confess'd<SPLIT>, the fault my own<SPLIT>. He neither could nor durst<SPLIT>, the guiltless youth<SPLIT>: Ye moon and stars<SPLIT>, bear witness to the truth<SPLIT>! His only crime (<SPLIT>if friendship can offend<SPLIT>) Is too much love to his unhappy friend<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Too late he speaks<SPLIT>: the sword<SPLIT>, which fury guides<SPLIT>, Driv'n with full force<SPLIT>, had pierc'd his tender sides<SPLIT>. Down fell the beauteous youth<SPLIT>: the yawning wound Gush'd out a purple stream<SPLIT>, and stain'd the ground<SPLIT>. His snowy neck reclines upon his breast<SPLIT>, Like a fair flow<SPLIT>'r by the keen share oppress'd<SPLIT>; Like a white poppy sinking on the plain<SPLIT>, Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain<SPLIT>. Despair<SPLIT>, and rage<SPLIT>, and vengeance justly vow'd<SPLIT>, Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd<SPLIT>. Volscens he seeks<SPLIT>; on him alone he bends<SPLIT>: Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends<SPLIT>, Onward he press'd<SPLIT>, and kept him still in sight<SPLIT>; Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might<SPLIT>: Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke<SPLIT>, Piered his wide mouth<SPLIT>, and thro<SPLIT>' his weazon broke<SPLIT>. Dying<SPLIT>, he slew<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, stagg<SPLIT>'ring on the plain<SPLIT>, With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain<SPLIT>; Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell<SPLIT>, Content<SPLIT>, in death<SPLIT>, to be reveng'd so well<SPLIT>.
O<SPLIT>happy friends<SPLIT>! for<SPLIT>, if my verse can give Immortal life<SPLIT>, your fame shall ever live<SPLIT>, Fix'd as the Capitol<SPLIT>'s foundation lies<SPLIT>, And spread<SPLIT>, where<SPLIT>'er the Roman eagle flies<SPLIT>!
The conqu'ring party first divide the prey<SPLIT>, Then their slain leader to the camp convey<SPLIT>. With wonder<SPLIT>, as they went<SPLIT>, the troops were fill'd<SPLIT>, To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd<SPLIT>. Serranus<SPLIT>, Rhamnes<SPLIT>, and the rest<SPLIT>, they found<SPLIT>: Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround<SPLIT>; And the yet reeking blood o<SPLIT>'erflows the ground<SPLIT>. All knew the helmet which Messapus lost<SPLIT>, But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost<SPLIT>. Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon<SPLIT>'s bed<SPLIT>, And with the dawn of day the skies o<SPLIT>'erspread<SPLIT>; Nor long the sun his daily course withheld<SPLIT>, But added colors to the world reveal'd<SPLIT>: When early Turnus<SPLIT>, wak<SPLIT>'ning with the light<SPLIT>, All clad in armor<SPLIT>, calls his troops to fight<SPLIT>. His martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd<SPLIT>, And his own ardor in their souls inspir'd<SPLIT>. This done<SPLIT>- to give new terror to his foes<SPLIT>, The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows<SPLIT>, Rais'd high on pointed spears<SPLIT>- a ghastly sight<SPLIT>: Loud peals of shouts ensue<SPLIT>, and barbarous delight<SPLIT>.
Meantime the Trojans run<SPLIT>, where danger calls<SPLIT>; They line their trenches<SPLIT>, and they man their walls<SPLIT>. In front extended to the left they stood<SPLIT>; Safe was the right<SPLIT>, surrounded by the flood<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view<SPLIT>, They saw the faces<SPLIT>, which too well they knew<SPLIT>, Tho<SPLIT>' then disguis'd in death<SPLIT>, and smear'd all o<SPLIT>'er With filth obscene<SPLIT>, and dropping putrid gore<SPLIT>. Soon hasty fame thro<SPLIT>' the sad city bears The mournful message to the mother<SPLIT>'s ears<SPLIT>. An icy cold benumbs her limbs<SPLIT>; she shakes<SPLIT>; Her cheeks the blood<SPLIT>, her hand the web forsakes<SPLIT>. She runs the rampires round amidst the war<SPLIT>, Nor fears the flying darts<SPLIT>; she rends her hair<SPLIT>, And fills with loud laments the liquid air<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Thus<SPLIT>, then<SPLIT>, my lov'd Euryalus appears<SPLIT>! Thus looks the prop my declining years<SPLIT>! Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed<SPLIT>? Ah<SPLIT>! how unlike the living is the dead<SPLIT>! And could<SPLIT>'st thou leave me<SPLIT>, cruel<SPLIT>, thus alone<SPLIT>? Not one kind kiss from a departing son<SPLIT>! No look<SPLIT>, no last adieu before he went<SPLIT>, In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent<SPLIT>! Cold on the ground<SPLIT>, and pressing foreign clay<SPLIT>, To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey<SPLIT>! Nor was I near to close his dying eyes<SPLIT>, To wash his wounds<SPLIT>, to weep his obsequies<SPLIT>, To call about his corpse his crying friends<SPLIT>, Or spread the mantle (<SPLIT>made for other ends<SPLIT>) On his dear body<SPLIT>, which I wove with care<SPLIT>, Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare<SPLIT>. Where shall I find his corpse<SPLIT>? what earth sustains His trunk dismember'd<SPLIT>, and his cold remains<SPLIT>? For this<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! I left my needful ease<SPLIT>, Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas<SPLIT>! If any pity touch Rutulian hearts<SPLIT>, Here empty all your quivers<SPLIT>, all your darts<SPLIT>; Or<SPLIT>, if they fail<SPLIT>, thou<SPLIT>, Jove<SPLIT>, conclude my woe<SPLIT>, And send me thunderstruck to shades below<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans<SPLIT>' ears<SPLIT>, Unman their courage<SPLIT>, and augment their fears<SPLIT>; Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain<SPLIT>, Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain<SPLIT>, But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent<SPLIT>, To bear the madding mother to her tent<SPLIT>.
And now the trumpets terribly<SPLIT>, from far<SPLIT>, With rattling clangor<SPLIT>, rouse the sleepy war<SPLIT>. The soldiers<SPLIT>' shouts succeed the brazen sounds<SPLIT>; And heav'n<SPLIT>, from pole to pole<SPLIT>, the noise rebounds<SPLIT>. The Volscians bear their shields upon their head<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, rushing forward<SPLIT>, form a moving shed<SPLIT>. These fill the ditch<SPLIT>; those pull the bulwarks down<SPLIT>: Some raise the ladders<SPLIT>; others scale the town<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, where void spaces on the walls appear<SPLIT>, Or thin defense<SPLIT>, they pour their forces there<SPLIT>. With poles and missive weapons<SPLIT>, from afar<SPLIT>, The Trojans keep aloof the rising war<SPLIT>. Taught<SPLIT>, by their ten years<SPLIT>' siege<SPLIT>, defensive fight<SPLIT>, They roll down ribs of rocks<SPLIT>, an unresisted weight<SPLIT>, To break the penthouse with the pond<SPLIT>'rous blow<SPLIT>, Which yet the patient Volscians undergo<SPLIT>: But could not bear th<SPLIT>' unequal combat long<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, where the Trojans find the thickest throng<SPLIT>, The ruin falls<SPLIT>: their shatter'd shields give way<SPLIT>, And their crush'd heads become an easy prey<SPLIT>. They shrink for fear<SPLIT>, abated of their rage<SPLIT>, Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage<SPLIT>; Contented now to gall them from below With darts and slings<SPLIT>, and with the distant bow<SPLIT>.
Elsewhere Mezentius<SPLIT>, terrible to view<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>blazing pine within the trenches threw<SPLIT>. But brave Messapus<SPLIT>, Neptune<SPLIT>'s warlike son<SPLIT>, Broke down the palisades<SPLIT>, the trenches won<SPLIT>, And loud for ladders calls<SPLIT>, to scale the town<SPLIT>.
Calliope<SPLIT>, begin<SPLIT>! Ye sacred Nine<SPLIT>, Inspire your poet in his high design<SPLIT>, To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made<SPLIT>, What souls he sent below the Stygian shade<SPLIT>, What fame the soldiers with their captain share<SPLIT>, And the vast circuit of the fatal war<SPLIT>; For you in singing martial facts excel<SPLIT>; You best remember<SPLIT>, and alone can tell<SPLIT>.
There stood a tow'r<SPLIT>, amazing to the sight<SPLIT>, Built up of beams<SPLIT>, and of stupendous height<SPLIT>: Art<SPLIT>, and the nature of the place<SPLIT>, conspir'd To furnish all the strength that war requir'd<SPLIT>. To level this<SPLIT>, the bold Italians join<SPLIT>; The wary Trojans obviate their design<SPLIT>; With weighty stones o<SPLIT>'erwhelm their troops below<SPLIT>, Shoot thro<SPLIT>' the loopholes<SPLIT>, and sharp jav'lins throw<SPLIT>. Turnus<SPLIT>, the chief<SPLIT>, toss'd from his thund<SPLIT>'ring hand Against the wooden walls<SPLIT>, a flaming brand<SPLIT>: It stuck<SPLIT>, the fiery plague<SPLIT>; the winds were high<SPLIT>; The planks were season'd<SPLIT>, and the timber dry<SPLIT>. Contagion caught the posts<SPLIT>; it spread along<SPLIT>, Scorch'd<SPLIT>, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng<SPLIT>. The Trojans fled<SPLIT>; the fire pursued amain<SPLIT>, Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train<SPLIT>; Till<SPLIT>, crowding to the corners of the wall<SPLIT>, Down the defense and the defenders fall<SPLIT>. The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound<SPLIT>: The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground<SPLIT>. The tow'r<SPLIT>, that follow'd on the fallen crew<SPLIT>, Whelm'd o<SPLIT>'er their heads<SPLIT>, and buried whom it slew<SPLIT>: Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent<SPLIT>; All the same equal ruin underwent<SPLIT>.
Young Lycus and Helenor only scape<SPLIT>; Sav'd<SPLIT>- how<SPLIT>, they know not- from the steepy leap<SPLIT>. Helenor<SPLIT>, elder of the two<SPLIT>: by birth<SPLIT>, On one side royal<SPLIT>, one a son of earth<SPLIT>, Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare<SPLIT>, And sent her boasted bastard to the war (<SPLIT>A privilege which none but freemen share<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>. Slight were his arms<SPLIT>, a sword and silver shield<SPLIT>: No marks of honor charg'd its empty field<SPLIT>. Light as he fell<SPLIT>, so light the youth arose<SPLIT>, And rising<SPLIT>, found himself amidst his foes<SPLIT>; Nor flight was left<SPLIT>, nor hopes to force his way<SPLIT>. Embolden'd by despair<SPLIT>, he stood at bay<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>- like a stag<SPLIT>, whom all the troop surrounds Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds<SPLIT>- Resolv'd on death<SPLIT>, he dissipates his fears<SPLIT>, And bounds aloft against the pointed spears<SPLIT>: So dares the youth<SPLIT>, secure of death<SPLIT>; and throws His dying body on his thickest foes<SPLIT>. But Lycus<SPLIT>, swifter of his feet by far<SPLIT>, Runs<SPLIT>, doubles<SPLIT>, winds and turns<SPLIT>, amidst the war<SPLIT>; Springs to the walls<SPLIT>, and leaves his foes behind<SPLIT>, And snatches at the beam he first can find<SPLIT>; Looks up<SPLIT>, and leaps aloft at all the stretch<SPLIT>, In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach<SPLIT>. But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey (<SPLIT>His spear had almost reach'd him in the way<SPLIT>, Short of his reins<SPLIT>, and scarce a span behind<SPLIT>) "<SPLIT>Fool<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" said the chief<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>tho<SPLIT>' fleeter than the wind<SPLIT>, Couldst thou presume to scape<SPLIT>, when I pursue<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and downward by the feet he drew The trembling dastard<SPLIT>; at the tug he falls<SPLIT>; Vast ruins come along<SPLIT>, rent from the smoking walls<SPLIT>. Thus on some silver swan<SPLIT>, or tim<SPLIT>'rous hare<SPLIT>, Jove<SPLIT>'s bird comes sousing down from upper air<SPLIT>; Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey<SPLIT>: Then out of sight she soars<SPLIT>, and wings her way<SPLIT>. So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb<SPLIT>, In vain lamented by the bleating dam<SPLIT>.
Then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry<SPLIT>, The troops of Turnus to the combat fly<SPLIT>. The ditch with fagots fill'd<SPLIT>, the daring foe Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw<SPLIT>.
Ilioneus<SPLIT>, as bold Lucetius came To force the gate<SPLIT>, and feed the kindling flame<SPLIT>, Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right<SPLIT>, It crush'd him double underneath the weight<SPLIT>. Two more young Liger and Asylas slew<SPLIT>: To bend the bow young Liger better knew<SPLIT>; Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw<SPLIT>. Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain<SPLIT>; The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain<SPLIT>. By the same hand<SPLIT>, Clonius and Itys fall<SPLIT>, Sagar<SPLIT>, and Ida<SPLIT>, standing on the wall<SPLIT>. From Capys<SPLIT>' arms his fate Privernus found<SPLIT>: Hurt by Themilla first-but slight the wound<SPLIT>- His shield thrown by<SPLIT>, to mitigate the smart<SPLIT>, He clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part<SPLIT>: The second shaft came swift and unespied<SPLIT>, And pierc'd his hand<SPLIT>, and nail'd it to his side<SPLIT>, Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart<SPLIT>: The soul came issuing out<SPLIT>, and hiss'd against the dart<SPLIT>.
The son of Arcens shone amid the rest<SPLIT>, In glitt<SPLIT>'ring armor and a purple vest<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Fair was his face<SPLIT>, his eyes inspiring love<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Bred by his father in the Martian grove<SPLIT>, Where the fat altars of Palicus flame<SPLIT>, And send in arms to purchase early fame<SPLIT>. Him when he spied from far<SPLIT>, the Tuscan king Laid by the lance<SPLIT>, and took him to the sling<SPLIT>, Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head<SPLIT>, and threw<SPLIT>: The heated lead half melted as it flew<SPLIT>; It pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain<SPLIT>; The youth came tumbling down<SPLIT>, and spurn'd the plain<SPLIT>.
Then young Ascanius<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, before this day<SPLIT>, Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey<SPLIT>, First bent in martial strife the twanging bow<SPLIT>, And exercis'd against a human foe- With this bereft Numanus of his life<SPLIT>, Who Turnus<SPLIT>' younger sister took to wife<SPLIT>. Proud of his realm<SPLIT>, and of his royal bride<SPLIT>, Vaunting before his troops<SPLIT>, and lengthen'd with a stride<SPLIT>, In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>Twice-conquer'd cowards<SPLIT>, now your shame is shown<SPLIT>- Coop'd up a second time within your town<SPLIT>! Who dare not issue forth in open field<SPLIT>, But hold your walls before you for a shield<SPLIT>. Thus threat you war<SPLIT>? thus our alliance force<SPLIT>? What gods<SPLIT>, what madness<SPLIT>, hether steer'd your course<SPLIT>? You shall not find the sons of Atreus here<SPLIT>, Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear<SPLIT>. Strong from the cradle<SPLIT>, of a sturdy brood<SPLIT>, We bear our newborn infants to the flood<SPLIT>; There bath'd amid the stream<SPLIT>, our boys we hold<SPLIT>, With winter harden'd<SPLIT>, and inur'd to cold<SPLIT>. They wake before the day to range the wood<SPLIT>, Kill ere they eat<SPLIT>, nor taste unconquer'd food<SPLIT>. No sports<SPLIT>, but what belong to war<SPLIT>, they know<SPLIT>: To break the stubborn colt<SPLIT>, to bend the bow<SPLIT>. Our youth<SPLIT>, of labor patient<SPLIT>, earn their bread<SPLIT>; Hardly they work<SPLIT>, with frugal diet fed<SPLIT>. From plows and harrows sent to seek renown<SPLIT>, They fight in fields<SPLIT>, and storm the shaken town<SPLIT>. No part of life from toils of war is free<SPLIT>, No change in age<SPLIT>, or diff'rence in degree<SPLIT>. We plow and till in arms<SPLIT>; our oxen feel<SPLIT>, Instead of goads<SPLIT>, the spur and pointed steel<SPLIT>; Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain<SPLIT>. Ev'n time<SPLIT>, that changes all<SPLIT>, yet changes us in vain<SPLIT>: The body<SPLIT>, not the mind<SPLIT>; nor can control Th' immortal vigor<SPLIT>, or abate the soul<SPLIT>. Our helms defend the young<SPLIT>, disguise the gray<SPLIT>: We live by plunder<SPLIT>, and delight in prey<SPLIT>. Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine<SPLIT>; In sloth you glory<SPLIT>, and in dances join<SPLIT>. Your vests have sweeping sleeves<SPLIT>; with female pride Your turbants underneath your chins are tied<SPLIT>. Go<SPLIT>, Phrygians<SPLIT>, to your Dindymus again<SPLIT>! Go<SPLIT>, less than women<SPLIT>, in the shapes of men<SPLIT>! Go<SPLIT>, mix'd with eunuchs<SPLIT>, in the Mother<SPLIT>'s rites<SPLIT>, Where with unequal sound the flute invites<SPLIT>; Sing<SPLIT>, dance<SPLIT>, and howl<SPLIT>, by turns<SPLIT>, in Ida<SPLIT>'s shade<SPLIT>: Resign the war to men<SPLIT>, who know the martial trade<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear With patience<SPLIT>, or a vow'd revenge forbear<SPLIT>. At the full stretch of both his hands he drew<SPLIT>, And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, first<SPLIT>, before the throne of Jove he stood<SPLIT>, And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>My first attempt<SPLIT>, great Jupiter<SPLIT>, succeed<SPLIT>! An annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>snow-white steer<SPLIT>, before thy altar led<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, like his mother<SPLIT>, bears aloft his head<SPLIT>, Butts with his threat<SPLIT>'ning brows<SPLIT>, and bellowing stands<SPLIT>, And dares the fight<SPLIT>, and spurns the yellow sands<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Jove bow'd the heav'ns<SPLIT>, and lent a gracious ear<SPLIT>, And thunder'd on the left<SPLIT>, amidst the clear<SPLIT>. Sounded at once the bow<SPLIT>; and swiftly flies The feather'd death<SPLIT>, and hisses thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>. The steel thro<SPLIT>' both his temples forc'd the way<SPLIT>: Extended on the ground<SPLIT>, Numanus lay<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Go now<SPLIT>, vain boaster<SPLIT>, and true valor scorn<SPLIT>! The Phrygians<SPLIT>, twice subdued<SPLIT>, yet make this third return<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Ascanius said no more<SPLIT>. The Trojans shake The heav'ns with shouting<SPLIT>, and new vigor take<SPLIT>.
Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud<SPLIT>, To view the feats of arms<SPLIT>, and fighting crowd<SPLIT>; And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Advance<SPLIT>, illustrious youth<SPLIT>, increase in fame<SPLIT>, And wide from east to west extend thy name<SPLIT>; Offspring of gods thyself<SPLIT>; and Rome shall owe To thee a race of demigods below<SPLIT>. This is the way to heav'n<SPLIT>: the pow'rs divine From this beginning date the Julian line<SPLIT>. To thee<SPLIT>, to them<SPLIT>, and their victorious heirs<SPLIT>, The conquer'd war is due<SPLIT>, and the vast world is theirs<SPLIT>. Troy is too narrow for thy name<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, And plunging downward shot his radiant head<SPLIT>; Dispell'd the breathing air<SPLIT>, that broke his flight<SPLIT>: Shorn of his beams<SPLIT>, a man to mortal sight<SPLIT>. Old Butes<SPLIT>' form he took<SPLIT>, Anchises<SPLIT>' squire<SPLIT>, Now left<SPLIT>, to rule Ascanius<SPLIT>, by his sire<SPLIT>: His wrinkled visage<SPLIT>, and his hoary hairs<SPLIT>, His mien<SPLIT>, his habit<SPLIT>, and his arms<SPLIT>, he wears<SPLIT>, And thus salutes the boy<SPLIT>, too forward for his years<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Suffice it thee<SPLIT>, thy father<SPLIT>'s worthy son<SPLIT>, The warlike prize thou hast already won<SPLIT>. The god of archers gives thy youth a part Of his own praise<SPLIT>, nor envies equal art<SPLIT>. Now tempt the war no more<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and flew Obscure in air<SPLIT>, and vanish'd from their view<SPLIT>. The Trojans<SPLIT>, by his arms<SPLIT>, their patron know<SPLIT>, And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow<SPLIT>. Then duteous force they use<SPLIT>, and Phoebus<SPLIT>' name<SPLIT>, To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame<SPLIT>. Undaunted<SPLIT>, they themselves no danger shun<SPLIT>; From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run<SPLIT>. They bend their bows<SPLIT>; they whirl their slings around<SPLIT>; Heaps of spent arrows fall<SPLIT>, and strew the ground<SPLIT>; And helms<SPLIT>, and shields<SPLIT>, and rattling arms resound<SPLIT>. The combat thickens<SPLIT>, like the storm that flies From westward<SPLIT>, when the show<SPLIT>'ry Kids arise<SPLIT>; Or patt<SPLIT>'ring hail comes pouring on the main<SPLIT>, When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain<SPLIT>, Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound<SPLIT>, And with an armed winter strew the ground<SPLIT>.
Pand<SPLIT>'rus and Bitias<SPLIT>, thunderbolts of war<SPLIT>, Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare On Ida<SPLIT>'s top<SPLIT>, two youths of height and size Like firs that on their mother mountain rise<SPLIT>, Presuming on their force<SPLIT>, the gates unbar<SPLIT>, And of their own accord invite the war<SPLIT>. With fates averse<SPLIT>, against their king<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>, Arm'd<SPLIT>, on the right and on the left they stand<SPLIT>, And flank the passage<SPLIT>: shining steel they wear<SPLIT>, And waving crests above their heads appear<SPLIT>. Thus two tall oaks<SPLIT>, that Padus<SPLIT>' banks adorn<SPLIT>, Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, overpress'd with nature<SPLIT>'s heavy load<SPLIT>, Dance to the whistling winds<SPLIT>, and at each other nod<SPLIT>. In flows a tide of Latians<SPLIT>, when they see The gate set open<SPLIT>, and the passage free<SPLIT>; Bold Quercens<SPLIT>, with rash Tmarus<SPLIT>, rushing on<SPLIT>, Equicolus<SPLIT>, that in bright armor shone<SPLIT>, And Haemon first<SPLIT>; but soon repuls'd they fly<SPLIT>, Or in the well-defended pass they die<SPLIT>. These with success are fir'd<SPLIT>, and those with rage<SPLIT>, And each on equal terms at length ingage<SPLIT>. Drawn from their lines<SPLIT>, and issuing on the plain<SPLIT>, The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain<SPLIT>.
Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought<SPLIT>, When suddenly th<SPLIT>' unhop'd-for news was brought<SPLIT>, The foes had left the fastness of their place<SPLIT>, Prevail'd in fight<SPLIT>, and had his men in chase<SPLIT>. He quits th<SPLIT>' attack<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, to prevent their fate<SPLIT>, Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate<SPLIT>. The first he met<SPLIT>, Antiphates the brave<SPLIT>, But base-begotten on a Theban slave<SPLIT>, Sarpedon<SPLIT>'s son<SPLIT>, he slew<SPLIT>: the deadly dart Found passage thro<SPLIT>' his breast<SPLIT>, and pierc'd his heart<SPLIT>. Fix'd in the wound th<SPLIT>' Italian cornel stood<SPLIT>, Warm'd in his lungs<SPLIT>, and in his vital blood<SPLIT>. Aphidnus next<SPLIT>, and Erymanthus dies<SPLIT>, And Meropes<SPLIT>, and the gigantic size Of Bitias<SPLIT>, threat<SPLIT>'ning with his ardent eyes<SPLIT>. Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd (<SPLIT>A dart were lost within that roomy breast<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, But from a knotted lance<SPLIT>, large<SPLIT>, heavy<SPLIT>, strong<SPLIT>, Which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along<SPLIT>: Not two bull hides th<SPLIT>' impetuous force withhold<SPLIT>, Nor coat of double mail<SPLIT>, with scales of gold<SPLIT>. Down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground<SPLIT>; His arms and clatt<SPLIT>'ring shield on the vast body sound<SPLIT>, Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole<SPLIT>, Rais'd on the seas<SPLIT>, the surges to control<SPLIT>- At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall<SPLIT>; Prone to the deep<SPLIT>, the stones disjointed fall Of the vast pile<SPLIT>; the scatter'd ocean flies<SPLIT>; Black sands<SPLIT>, discolor'd froth<SPLIT>, and mingled mud arise<SPLIT>: The frighted billows roll<SPLIT>, and seek the shores<SPLIT>; Then trembles Prochyta<SPLIT>, then Ischia roars<SPLIT>: Typhoeus<SPLIT>, thrown beneath<SPLIT>, by Jove<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>, Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land<SPLIT>, Soon shifts his weary side<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, scarce awake<SPLIT>, With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back<SPLIT>.
The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd<SPLIT>, New strung their sinews<SPLIT>, and their courage fir'd<SPLIT>, But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright<SPLIT>: Then black despair precipitates their flight<SPLIT>.
When Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd<SPLIT>, The town with fear and wild confusion fill'd<SPLIT>, He turns the hinges of the heavy gate With both his hands<SPLIT>, and adds his shoulders to the weight Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd<SPLIT>; The rest shut out<SPLIT>, to certain death expos'd<SPLIT>: Fool as he was<SPLIT>, and frantic in his care<SPLIT>, T' admit young Turnus<SPLIT>, and include the war<SPLIT>! He thrust amid the crowd<SPLIT>, securely bold<SPLIT>, Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold<SPLIT>. Too late his blazing buckler they descry<SPLIT>, And sparkling fires that shot from either eye<SPLIT>, His mighty members<SPLIT>, and his ample breast<SPLIT>, His rattling armor<SPLIT>, and his crimson crest<SPLIT>.
Far from that hated face the Trojans fly<SPLIT>, All but the fool who sought his destiny<SPLIT>. Mad Pandarus steps forth<SPLIT>, with vengeance vow'd For Bitias<SPLIT>' death<SPLIT>, and threatens thus aloud<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>These are not Ardea<SPLIT>'s walls<SPLIT>, nor this the town Amata proffers with Lavinia<SPLIT>'s crown<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>T is hostile earth you tread<SPLIT>. Of hope bereft<SPLIT>, No means of safe return by flight are left<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" To whom<SPLIT>, with count<SPLIT>'nance calm<SPLIT>, and soul sedate<SPLIT>, Thus Turnus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Then begin<SPLIT>, and try thy fate<SPLIT>: My message to the ghost of Priam bear<SPLIT>; Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
A<SPLIT>lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw<SPLIT>, Rough in the rind<SPLIT>, and knotted as it grew<SPLIT>: With his full force he whirl'd it first around<SPLIT>; But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound<SPLIT>: Imperial Juno turn'd the course before<SPLIT>, And fix'd the wand<SPLIT>'ring weapon in the door<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>But hope not thou<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said Turnus<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>when I strike<SPLIT>, To shun thy fate<SPLIT>: our force is not alike<SPLIT>, Nor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then rising<SPLIT>, on his utmost stretch he stood<SPLIT>, And aim'd from high<SPLIT>: the full descending blow Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two<SPLIT>. Down sinks the giant with a thund<SPLIT>'ring sound<SPLIT>: His pond<SPLIT>'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground<SPLIT>; Blood<SPLIT>, brains<SPLIT>, and foam gush from the gaping wound<SPLIT>: Scalp<SPLIT>, face<SPLIT>, and shoulders the keen steel divides<SPLIT>, And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides<SPLIT>. The Trojans fly from their approaching fate<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, had the victor then secur'd the gate<SPLIT>, And to his troops without unclos'd the bars<SPLIT>, One lucky day had ended all his wars<SPLIT>. But boiling youth<SPLIT>, and blind desire of blood<SPLIT>, Push'd on his fury<SPLIT>, to pursue the crowd<SPLIT>. Hamstring'd behind<SPLIT>, unhappy Gyges died<SPLIT>; Then Phalaris is added to his side<SPLIT>. The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew<SPLIT>, And their friends<SPLIT>' arms against their fellows threw<SPLIT>. Strong Halys stands in vain<SPLIT>; weak Phlegys flies<SPLIT>; Saturnia<SPLIT>, still at hand<SPLIT>, new force and fire supplies<SPLIT>. Then Halius<SPLIT>, Prytanis<SPLIT>, Alcander fall<SPLIT>- Ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall<SPLIT>: But<SPLIT>, whom they fear'd without<SPLIT>, they found within<SPLIT>. At last<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' late<SPLIT>, by Lynceus he was seen<SPLIT>. He calls new succors<SPLIT>, and assaults the prince<SPLIT>: But weak his force<SPLIT>, and vain is their defense<SPLIT>. Turn'd to the right<SPLIT>, his sword the hero drew<SPLIT>, And at one blow the bold aggressor slew<SPLIT>. He joints the neck<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, with a stroke so strong<SPLIT>, The helm flies off<SPLIT>, and bears the head along<SPLIT>. Next him<SPLIT>, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd<SPLIT>, In darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd<SPLIT>. Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear<SPLIT>, And Creteus<SPLIT>, whom the Muses held so dear<SPLIT>: He fought with courage<SPLIT>, and he sung the fight<SPLIT>; Arms were his bus'ness<SPLIT>, verses his delight<SPLIT>.
The Trojan chiefs behold<SPLIT>, with rage and grief<SPLIT>, Their slaughter'd friends<SPLIT>, and hasten their relief<SPLIT>. Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train<SPLIT>, Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain<SPLIT>. To save the living<SPLIT>, and revenge the dead<SPLIT>, Against one warrior<SPLIT>'s arms all Troy they led<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>O<SPLIT>, void of sense and courage<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" Mnestheus cried<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>Where can you hope your coward heads to hide<SPLIT>? Ah<SPLIT>! where beyond these rampires can you run<SPLIT>? One man<SPLIT>, and in your camp inclos'd<SPLIT>, you shun<SPLIT>! Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast<SPLIT>, And pass unpunish'd from a num<SPLIT>'rous host<SPLIT>? Forsaking honor<SPLIT>, and renouncing fame<SPLIT>, Your gods<SPLIT>, your country<SPLIT>, and your king you shame<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" This just reproach their virtue does excite<SPLIT>: They stand<SPLIT>, they join<SPLIT>, they thicken to the fight<SPLIT>.
Now Turnus doubts<SPLIT>, and yet disdains to yield<SPLIT>, But with slow paces measures back the field<SPLIT>, And inches to the walls<SPLIT>, where Tiber<SPLIT>'s tide<SPLIT>, Washing the camp<SPLIT>, defends the weaker side<SPLIT>. The more he loses<SPLIT>, they advance the more<SPLIT>, And tread in ev'ry step he trod before<SPLIT>. They shout<SPLIT>: they bear him back<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, whom by might They cannot conquer<SPLIT>, they oppress with weight<SPLIT>.
As<SPLIT>, compass'd with a wood of spears around<SPLIT>, The lordly lion still maintains his ground<SPLIT>; Grins horrible<SPLIT>, retires<SPLIT>, and turns again<SPLIT>; Threats his distended paws<SPLIT>, and shakes his mane<SPLIT>; He loses while in vain he presses on<SPLIT>, Nor will his courage let him dare to run<SPLIT>: So Turnus fares<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, unresolved of flight<SPLIT>, Moves tardy back<SPLIT>, and just recedes from fight<SPLIT>. Yet twice<SPLIT>, inrag'd<SPLIT>, the combat he renews<SPLIT>, Twice breaks<SPLIT>, and twice his broken foes pursues<SPLIT>. But now they swarm<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, with fresh troops supplied<SPLIT>, Come rolling on<SPLIT>, and rush from ev'ry side<SPLIT>: Nor Juno<SPLIT>, who sustain'd his arms before<SPLIT>, Dares with new strength suffice th<SPLIT>' exhausted store<SPLIT>; For Jove<SPLIT>, with sour commands<SPLIT>, sent Iris down<SPLIT>, To force th<SPLIT>' invader from the frighted town<SPLIT>.
With labor spent<SPLIT>, no longer can he wield The heavy fanchion<SPLIT>, or sustain the shield<SPLIT>, O'erwhelm'd with darts<SPLIT>, which from afar they fling<SPLIT>: The weapons round his hollow temples ring<SPLIT>; His golden helm gives way<SPLIT>, with stony blows Batter'd<SPLIT>, and flat<SPLIT>, and beaten to his brows<SPLIT>. His crest is rash'd away<SPLIT>; his ample shield Is falsified<SPLIT>, and round with jav'lins fill'd<SPLIT>.
The foe<SPLIT>, now faint<SPLIT>, the Trojans overwhelm<SPLIT>; And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm<SPLIT>. Sick sweat succeeds<SPLIT>; he drops at ev'ry pore<SPLIT>; With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>; Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes<SPLIT>; And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes<SPLIT>. Plung'd in the flood<SPLIT>, and made the waters fly<SPLIT>. The yellow god the welcome burthen bore<SPLIT>, And wip'd the sweat<SPLIT>, and wash'd away the gore<SPLIT>; Then gently wafts him to the farther coast<SPLIT>, And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host<SPLIT>.

BOOK X
The gates of heav'n unfold<SPLIT>: Jove summons all The gods to council in the common hall<SPLIT>. Sublimely seated<SPLIT>, he surveys from far The fields<SPLIT>, the camp<SPLIT>, the fortune of the war<SPLIT>, And all th<SPLIT>' inferior world<SPLIT>. From first to last<SPLIT>, The sov'reign senate in degrees are plac'd<SPLIT>.
Then thus th<SPLIT>' almighty sire began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Ye gods<SPLIT>, Natives or denizens of blest abodes<SPLIT>, From whence these murmurs<SPLIT>, and this change of mind<SPLIT>, This backward fate from what was first design'd<SPLIT>? Why this protracted war<SPLIT>, when my commands Pronounc'd a peace<SPLIT>, and gave the Latian lands<SPLIT>? What fear or hope on either part divides Our heav'ns<SPLIT>, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides<SPLIT>? A<SPLIT>lawful time of war at length will come<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Nor need your haste anticipate the doom<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome<SPLIT>, Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, like a flood<SPLIT>, come pouring on the plains<SPLIT>. Then is your time for faction and debate<SPLIT>, For partial favor<SPLIT>, and permitted hate<SPLIT>. Let now your immature dissension cease<SPLIT>; Sit quiet<SPLIT>, and compose your souls to peace<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge<SPLIT>; But lovely Venus thus replies at large<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O pow'r immense<SPLIT>, eternal energy<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>For to what else protection can we fly<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>) Seest thou the proud Rutulians<SPLIT>, how they dare In fields<SPLIT>, unpunish'd<SPLIT>, and insult my care<SPLIT>? How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train<SPLIT>, In shining arms<SPLIT>, triumphant on the plain<SPLIT>? Ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend<SPLIT>, And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend<SPLIT>: The town is fill'd with slaughter<SPLIT>, and o<SPLIT>'erfloats<SPLIT>, With a red deluge<SPLIT>, their increasing moats<SPLIT>. Aeneas<SPLIT>, ignorant<SPLIT>, and far from thence<SPLIT>, Has left a camp expos'd<SPLIT>, without defense<SPLIT>. This endless outrage shall they still sustain<SPLIT>? Shall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again<SPLIT>? A<SPLIT>second siege my banish'd issue fears<SPLIT>, And a new Diomede in arms appears<SPLIT>. One more audacious mortal will be found<SPLIT>; And I<SPLIT>, thy daughter<SPLIT>, wait another wound<SPLIT>. Yet<SPLIT>, if with fates averse<SPLIT>, without thy leave<SPLIT>, The Latian lands my progeny receive<SPLIT>, Bear they the pains of violated law<SPLIT>, And thy protection from their aid withdraw<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, if the gods their sure success foretell<SPLIT>; If those of heav'n consent with those of hell<SPLIT>, To promise Italy<SPLIT>; who dare debate The pow'r of Jove<SPLIT>, or fix another fate<SPLIT>? What should I tell of tempests on the main<SPLIT>, Of Aeolus usurping Neptune<SPLIT>'s reign<SPLIT>? Of Iris sent<SPLIT>, with Bacchanalian heat T' inspire the matrons<SPLIT>, and destroy the fleet<SPLIT>? Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends<SPLIT>, Solicits hell for aid<SPLIT>, and arms the fiends<SPLIT>. That new example wanted yet above<SPLIT>: An act that well became the wife of Jove<SPLIT>! Alecto<SPLIT>, rais'd by her<SPLIT>, with rage inflames The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames<SPLIT>. Imperial sway no more exalts my mind<SPLIT>; (<SPLIT>Such hopes I had indeed<SPLIT>, while Heav'n was kind<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>) Now let my happier foes possess my place<SPLIT>, Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race<SPLIT>; And conquer they<SPLIT>, whom you with conquest grace<SPLIT>. Since you can spare<SPLIT>, from all your wide command<SPLIT>, No spot of earth<SPLIT>, no hospitable land<SPLIT>, Which may my wand<SPLIT>'ring fugitives receive<SPLIT>; (<SPLIT>Since haughty Juno will not give you leave<SPLIT>;<SPLIT>) Then<SPLIT>, father<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>if I still may use that name<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) By ruin'd Troy<SPLIT>, yet smoking from the flame<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>beg you<SPLIT>, let Ascanius<SPLIT>, by my care<SPLIT>, Be freed from danger<SPLIT>, and dismiss'd the war<SPLIT>: Inglorious let him live<SPLIT>, without a crown<SPLIT>. The father may be cast on coasts unknown<SPLIT>, Struggling with fate<SPLIT>; but let me save the son<SPLIT>. Mine is Cythera<SPLIT>, mine the Cyprian tow'rs<SPLIT>: In those recesses<SPLIT>, and those sacred bow<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, Obscurely let him rest<SPLIT>; his right resign To promis'd empire<SPLIT>, and his Julian line<SPLIT>. Then Carthage may th<SPLIT>' Ausonian towns destroy<SPLIT>, Nor fear the race of a rejected boy<SPLIT>. What profits it my son to scape the fire<SPLIT>, Arm'd with his gods<SPLIT>, and loaded with his sire<SPLIT>; To pass the perils of the seas and wind<SPLIT>; Evade the Greeks<SPLIT>, and leave the war behind<SPLIT>; To reach th<SPLIT>' Italian shores<SPLIT>; if<SPLIT>, after all<SPLIT>, Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall<SPLIT>? Much better had he curb'd his high desires<SPLIT>, And hover'd o<SPLIT>'er his ill-extinguish'd fires<SPLIT>. To Simois<SPLIT>' banks the fugitives restore<SPLIT>, And give them back to war<SPLIT>, and all the woes before<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Deep indignation swell'd Saturnia<SPLIT>'s heart<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>And must I own<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" she said<SPLIT>, "my secret smart<SPLIT>- What with more decence were in silence kept<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, but for this unjust reproach<SPLIT>, had slept<SPLIT>? Did god or man your fav'rite son advise<SPLIT>, With war unhop'd the Latians to surprise<SPLIT>? By fate<SPLIT>, you boast<SPLIT>, and by the gods<SPLIT>' decree<SPLIT>, He left his native land for Italy<SPLIT>! Confess the truth<SPLIT>; by mad Cassandra<SPLIT>, more Than Heav'n inspir'd<SPLIT>, he sought a foreign shore<SPLIT>! Did I persuade to trust his second Troy To the raw conduct of a beardless boy<SPLIT>, With walls unfinish'd<SPLIT>, which himself forsakes<SPLIT>, And thro<SPLIT>' the waves a wand<SPLIT>'ring voyage takes<SPLIT>? When have I urg'd him meanly to demand The Tuscan aid<SPLIT>, and arm a quiet land<SPLIT>? Did I or Iris give this mad advice<SPLIT>, Or made the fool himself the fatal choice<SPLIT>? You think it hard<SPLIT>, the Latians should destroy With swords your Trojans<SPLIT>, and with fires your Troy<SPLIT>! Hard and unjust indeed<SPLIT>, for men to draw Their native air<SPLIT>, nor take a foreign law<SPLIT>! That Turnus is permitted still to live<SPLIT>, To whom his birth a god and goddess give<SPLIT>! But yet is just and lawful for your line To drive their fields<SPLIT>, and force with fraud to join<SPLIT>; Realms<SPLIT>, not your own<SPLIT>, among your clans divide<SPLIT>, And from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride<SPLIT>; Petition<SPLIT>, while you public arms prepare<SPLIT>; Pretend a peace<SPLIT>, and yet provoke a war<SPLIT>! '<SPLIT>T was giv'n to you<SPLIT>, your darling son to shroud<SPLIT>, To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, for a man<SPLIT>, obtend an empty cloud<SPLIT>. From flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away<SPLIT>, And chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea<SPLIT>. But is my crime<SPLIT>- the Queen of Heav'n offends<SPLIT>, If she presume to save her suff'ring friends<SPLIT>! Your son<SPLIT>, not knowing what his foes decree<SPLIT>, You say<SPLIT>, is absent<SPLIT>: absent let him be<SPLIT>. Yours is Cythera<SPLIT>, yours the Cyprian tow'rs<SPLIT>, The soft recesses<SPLIT>, and the sacred bow<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>. Why do you then these needless arms prepare<SPLIT>, And thus provoke a people prone to war<SPLIT>? Did I with fire the Trojan town deface<SPLIT>, Or hinder from return your exil'd race<SPLIT>? Was I the cause of mischief<SPLIT>, or the man Whose lawless lust the fatal war began<SPLIT>? Think on whose faith th<SPLIT>' adult<SPLIT>'rous youth relied<SPLIT>; Who promis'd<SPLIT>, who procur'd<SPLIT>, the Spartan bride<SPLIT>? When all th<SPLIT>' united states of Greece combin'd<SPLIT>, To purge the world of the perfidious kind<SPLIT>, Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate<SPLIT>: Your quarrels and complaints are now too late<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus Juno<SPLIT>. Murmurs rise<SPLIT>, with mix'd applause<SPLIT>, Just as they favor or dislike the cause<SPLIT>. So winds<SPLIT>, when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie<SPLIT>, In whispers first their tender voices try<SPLIT>, Then issue on the main with bellowing rage<SPLIT>, And storms to trembling mariners presage<SPLIT>.
Then thus to both replied th<SPLIT>' imperial god<SPLIT>, Who shakes heav'n<SPLIT>'s axles with his awful nod<SPLIT>. (<SPLIT>When he begins<SPLIT>, the silent senate stand With rev'rence<SPLIT>, list<SPLIT>'ning to the dread command<SPLIT>: The clouds dispel<SPLIT>; the winds their breath restrain<SPLIT>; And the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>) "<SPLIT>Celestials<SPLIT>, your attentive ears incline<SPLIT>! Since<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said the god<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>the Trojans must not join In wish'd alliance with the Latian line<SPLIT>; Since endless jarrings and immortal hate Tend but to discompose our happy state<SPLIT>; The war henceforward be resign'd to fate<SPLIT>: Each to his proper fortune stand or fall<SPLIT>; Equal and unconcer<SPLIT>n'd I look on all<SPLIT>. Rutulians<SPLIT>, Trojans<SPLIT>, are the same to me<SPLIT>; And both shall draw the lots their fates decree<SPLIT>. Let these assault<SPLIT>, if Fortune be their friend<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, if she favors those<SPLIT>, let those defend<SPLIT>: The Fates will find their way<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The Thund<SPLIT>'rer said<SPLIT>, And shook the sacred honors of his head<SPLIT>, Attesting Styx<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' inviolable flood<SPLIT>, And the black regions of his brother god<SPLIT>. Trembled the poles of heav'n<SPLIT>, and earth confess'd the nod<SPLIT>. This end the sessions had<SPLIT>: the senate rise<SPLIT>, And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>.
Meantime<SPLIT>, intent upon their siege<SPLIT>, the foes Within their walls the Trojan host inclose<SPLIT>: They wound<SPLIT>, they kill<SPLIT>, they watch at ev'ry gate<SPLIT>; Renew the fires<SPLIT>, and urge their happy fate<SPLIT>.
Th' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief<SPLIT>, Hopeless of flight<SPLIT>, more hopeless of relief<SPLIT>. Thin on the tow'rs they stand<SPLIT>; and ev'n those few A<SPLIT>feeble<SPLIT>, fainting<SPLIT>, and dejected crew<SPLIT>. Yet in the face of danger some there stood<SPLIT>: The two bold brothers of Sarpedon<SPLIT>'s blood<SPLIT>, Asius and Acmon<SPLIT>; both th<SPLIT>' Assaraci<SPLIT>; Young Haemon<SPLIT>, and tho<SPLIT>' young<SPLIT>, resolv'd to die<SPLIT>. With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd<SPLIT>; Tibris and Castor<SPLIT>, both of Lycian kind<SPLIT>. From Acmon<SPLIT>'s hands a rolling stone there came<SPLIT>, So large<SPLIT>, it half deserv'd a mountain<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>: Strong-sinew'd was the youth<SPLIT>, and big of bone<SPLIT>; His brother Mnestheus could not more have done<SPLIT>, Or the great father of th<SPLIT>' intrepid son<SPLIT>. Some firebrands throw<SPLIT>, some flights of arrows send<SPLIT>; And some with darts<SPLIT>, and some with stones defend<SPLIT>.
Amid the press appears the beauteous boy<SPLIT>, The care of Venus<SPLIT>, and the hope of Troy<SPLIT>. His lovely face unarm'd<SPLIT>, his head was bare<SPLIT>; In ringlets o<SPLIT>'er his shoulders hung his hair<SPLIT>. His forehead circled with a diadem<SPLIT>; Distinguish'd from the crowd<SPLIT>, he shines a gem<SPLIT>, Enchas'd in gold<SPLIT>, or polish'd iv'ry set<SPLIT>, Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet<SPLIT>.
Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war<SPLIT>, Directing pointed arrows from afar<SPLIT>, And death with poison arm'd<SPLIT>- in Lydia born<SPLIT>, Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn<SPLIT>; Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands<SPLIT>, And leaves a rich manure of golden sands<SPLIT>. There Capys<SPLIT>, author of the Capuan name<SPLIT>, And there was Mnestheus too<SPLIT>, increas'd in fame<SPLIT>, Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame<SPLIT>.
Thus mortal war was wag'd on either side<SPLIT>. Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide<SPLIT>: For<SPLIT>, anxious<SPLIT>, from Evander when he went<SPLIT>, He sought the Tyrrhene camp<SPLIT>, and Tarchon<SPLIT>'s tent<SPLIT>; Expos'd the cause of coming to the chief<SPLIT>; His name and country told<SPLIT>, and ask'd relief<SPLIT>; Propos'd the terms<SPLIT>; his own small strength declar'd<SPLIT>; What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd<SPLIT>: What Turnus<SPLIT>, bold and violent<SPLIT>, design'd<SPLIT>; Then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind<SPLIT>, And fickle fortune<SPLIT>; war<SPLIT>n'd him to beware<SPLIT>, And to his wholesome counsel added pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>. Tarchon<SPLIT>, without delay<SPLIT>, the treaty signs<SPLIT>, And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins<SPLIT>.
They soon set sail<SPLIT>; nor now the fates withstand<SPLIT>; Their forces trusted with a foreign hand<SPLIT>. Aeneas leads<SPLIT>; upon his stern appear Two lions carv'd<SPLIT>, which rising Ida bear- Ida<SPLIT>, to wand<SPLIT>'ring Trojans ever dear<SPLIT>. Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate<SPLIT>, Revolving war<SPLIT>'s events<SPLIT>, and various fate<SPLIT>. His left young Pallas kept<SPLIT>, fix'd to his side<SPLIT>, And oft of winds enquir'd<SPLIT>, and of the tide<SPLIT>; Oft of the stars<SPLIT>, and of their wat<SPLIT>'ry way<SPLIT>; And what he suffer'd both by land and sea<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, sacred sisters<SPLIT>, open all your spring<SPLIT>! The Tuscan leaders<SPLIT>, and their army sing<SPLIT>, Which follow'd great Aeneas to the war<SPLIT>: Their arms<SPLIT>, their numbers<SPLIT>, and their names declare<SPLIT>.
A<SPLIT>thousand youths brave Massicus obey<SPLIT>, Borne in the Tiger thro<SPLIT>' the foaming sea<SPLIT>; From Asium brought<SPLIT>, and Cosa<SPLIT>, by his care<SPLIT>: For arms<SPLIT>, light quivers<SPLIT>, bows and shafts<SPLIT>, they bear<SPLIT>. Fierce Abas next<SPLIT>: his men bright armor wore<SPLIT>; His stern Apollo<SPLIT>'s golden statue bore<SPLIT>. Six hundred Populonia sent along<SPLIT>, All skill'd in martial exercise<SPLIT>, and strong<SPLIT>. Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins<SPLIT>, An isle renown'd for steel<SPLIT>, and unexhausted mines<SPLIT>. Asylas on his prow the third appears<SPLIT>, Who heav'n interprets<SPLIT>, and the wand<SPLIT>'ring stars<SPLIT>; From offer'd entrails prodigies expounds<SPLIT>, And peals of thunder<SPLIT>, with presaging sounds<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>thousand spears in warlike order stand<SPLIT>, Sent by the Pisans under his command<SPLIT>.
Fair Astur follows in the wat<SPLIT>'ry field<SPLIT>, Proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield<SPLIT>. Gravisca<SPLIT>, noisome from the neighb'ring fen<SPLIT>, And his own Caere<SPLIT>, sent three hundred men<SPLIT>; With those which Minio<SPLIT>'s fields and Pyrgi gave<SPLIT>, All bred in arms<SPLIT>, unanimous<SPLIT>, and brave<SPLIT>.
Thou<SPLIT>, Muse<SPLIT>, the name of Cinyras renew<SPLIT>, And brave Cupavo follow'd but by few<SPLIT>; Whose helm confess'd the lineage of the man<SPLIT>, And bore<SPLIT>, with wings display'd<SPLIT>, a silver swan<SPLIT>. Love was the fault of his fam'd ancestry<SPLIT>, Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly<SPLIT>. For Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton<SPLIT>, And sung his loss in poplar groves<SPLIT>, alone<SPLIT>, Beneath the sister shades<SPLIT>, to soothe his grief<SPLIT>. Heav'n heard his song<SPLIT>, and hasten'd his relief<SPLIT>, And chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair<SPLIT>, And wing'd his flight<SPLIT>, to chant aloft in air<SPLIT>. His son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood<SPLIT>: Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood<SPLIT>, Who heav'd a rock<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, threat<SPLIT>'ning still to throw<SPLIT>, With lifted hands alarm'd the seas below<SPLIT>: They seem'd to fear the formidable sight<SPLIT>, And roll'd their billows on<SPLIT>, to speed his flight<SPLIT>.
Ocnus was next<SPLIT>, who led his native train Of hardy warriors thro<SPLIT>' the wat<SPLIT>'ry plain<SPLIT>: The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream<SPLIT>, From whence the Mantuan town derives the name<SPLIT>- An ancient city<SPLIT>, but of mix'd descent<SPLIT>: Three sev'ral tribes compose the government<SPLIT>; Four towns are under each<SPLIT>; but all obey The Mantuan laws<SPLIT>, and own the Tuscan sway<SPLIT>.
Hate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more<SPLIT>, Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore<SPLIT>: Mincius<SPLIT>, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>. These grave Auletes leads<SPLIT>: a hundred sweep With stretching oars at once the glassy deep<SPLIT>. Him and his martial train the Triton bears<SPLIT>; High on his poop the sea-green god appears<SPLIT>: Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound<SPLIT>, And at the blast the billows dance around<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>hairy man above the waist he shows<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>porpoise tail beneath his belly grows<SPLIT>; And ends a fish<SPLIT>: his breast the waves divides<SPLIT>, And froth and foam augment the murm<SPLIT>'ring tides<SPLIT>.
Full thirty ships transport the chosen train For Troy<SPLIT>'s relief<SPLIT>, and scour the briny main<SPLIT>.
Now was the world forsaken by the sun<SPLIT>, And Phoebe half her nightly race had run<SPLIT>. The careful chief<SPLIT>, who never clos'd his eyes<SPLIT>, Himself the rudder holds<SPLIT>, the sails supplies<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>choir of Nereids meet him on the flood<SPLIT>, Once his own galleys<SPLIT>, hewn from Ida<SPLIT>'s wood<SPLIT>; But now<SPLIT>, as many nymphs<SPLIT>, the sea they sweep<SPLIT>, As rode<SPLIT>, before<SPLIT>, tall vessels on the deep<SPLIT>. They know him from afar<SPLIT>; and in a ring Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king<SPLIT>. Cymodoce<SPLIT>, whose voice excell'd the rest<SPLIT>, Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast<SPLIT>; Her right hand stops the stern<SPLIT>; her left divides The curling ocean<SPLIT>, and corrects the tides<SPLIT>. She spoke for all the choir<SPLIT>, and thus began With pleasing words to warn th<SPLIT>' unknowing man<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Sleeps our lov'd lord<SPLIT>? O goddess-born<SPLIT>, awake<SPLIT>! Spread ev'ry sail<SPLIT>, pursue your wat<SPLIT>'ry track<SPLIT>, And haste your course<SPLIT>. Your navy once were we<SPLIT>, From Ida<SPLIT>'s height descending to the sea<SPLIT>; Till Turnus<SPLIT>, as at anchor fix'd we stood<SPLIT>, Presum'd to violate our holy wood<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, loos'd from shore<SPLIT>, we fled his fires profane (<SPLIT>Unwillingly we broke our master<SPLIT>'s chain<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, And since have sought you thro<SPLIT>' the Tuscan main<SPLIT>. The mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these<SPLIT>, And gave us life immortal in the seas<SPLIT>. But young Ascanius<SPLIT>, in his camp distress'd<SPLIT>, By your insulting foes is hardly press'd<SPLIT>. Th' Arcadian horsemen<SPLIT>, and Etrurian host<SPLIT>, Advance in order on the Latian coast<SPLIT>: To cut their way the Daunian chief designs<SPLIT>, Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines<SPLIT>. Thou<SPLIT>, when the rosy morn restores the light<SPLIT>, First arm thy soldiers for th<SPLIT>' ensuing fight<SPLIT>: Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield<SPLIT>, And bear aloft th<SPLIT>' impenetrable shield<SPLIT>. To-morrow<SPLIT>'s sun<SPLIT>, unless my skill be vain<SPLIT>, Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Parting<SPLIT>, she spoke<SPLIT>; and with immortal force Push'd on the vessel in her wat<SPLIT>'ry course<SPLIT>; For well she knew the way<SPLIT>. Impell'd behind<SPLIT>, The ship flew forward<SPLIT>, and outstripp'd the wind<SPLIT>. The rest make up<SPLIT>. Unknowing of the cause<SPLIT>, The chief admires their speed<SPLIT>, and happy omens draws<SPLIT>.
Then thus he pray'd<SPLIT>, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Hear thou<SPLIT>, great Mother of the deities<SPLIT>. With turrets crown'd<SPLIT>! (<SPLIT>on Ida<SPLIT>'s holy hill Fierce tigers<SPLIT>, rein'd and curb'd<SPLIT>, obey thy will<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>) Firm thy own omens<SPLIT>; lead us on to fight<SPLIT>; And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said no more<SPLIT>. And now renewing day Had chas'd the shadows of the night away<SPLIT>. He charg'd the soldiers<SPLIT>, with preventing care<SPLIT>, Their flags to follow<SPLIT>, and their arms prepare<SPLIT>; Warn'd of th<SPLIT>' ensuing fight<SPLIT>, and bade 'em hope the war<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, his lofty poop<SPLIT>, he view'd below His camp incompass'd<SPLIT>, and th<SPLIT>' inclosing foe<SPLIT>. His blazing shield<SPLIT>, imbrac'd<SPLIT>, he held on high<SPLIT>; The camp receive the sign<SPLIT>, and with loud shouts reply<SPLIT>. Hope arms their courage<SPLIT>: from their tow'rs they throw Their darts with double force<SPLIT>, and drive the foe<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, at the signal giv'n<SPLIT>, the cranes arise Before the stormy south<SPLIT>, and blacken all the skies<SPLIT>.
King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd<SPLIT>, Till<SPLIT>, looking back<SPLIT>, the Trojan fleet he view'd<SPLIT>, The seas with swelling canvas cover'd o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, And the swift ships descending on the shore<SPLIT>. The Latians saw from far<SPLIT>, with dazzled eyes<SPLIT>, The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise<SPLIT>, And dart diffusive fires around the field<SPLIT>, And the keen glitt<SPLIT>'ring of the golden shield<SPLIT>. Thus threat<SPLIT>'ning comets<SPLIT>, when by night they rise<SPLIT>, Shoot sanguine streams<SPLIT>, and sadden all the skies<SPLIT>: So Sirius<SPLIT>, flashing forth sinister lights<SPLIT>, Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright<SPLIT>:
Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent To man the shores<SPLIT>, and hinder their descent<SPLIT>, And thus awakes the courage of his friends<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What you so long have wish'd<SPLIT>, kind Fortune sends<SPLIT>; In ardent arms to meet th<SPLIT>' invading foe<SPLIT>: You find<SPLIT>, and find him at advantage now<SPLIT>. Yours is the day<SPLIT>: you need but only dare<SPLIT>; Your swords will make you masters of the war<SPLIT>. Your sires<SPLIT>, your sons<SPLIT>, your houses<SPLIT>, and your lands<SPLIT>, And dearest wifes<SPLIT>, are all within your hands<SPLIT>. Be mindful of the race from whence you came<SPLIT>, And emulate in arms your fathers<SPLIT>' fame<SPLIT>. Now take the time<SPLIT>, while stagg<SPLIT>'ring yet they stand With feet unfirm<SPLIT>, and prepossess the strand<SPLIT>: Fortune befriends the bold<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Nor more he said<SPLIT>, But balanc'd whom to leave<SPLIT>, and whom to lead<SPLIT>; Then these elects<SPLIT>, the landing to prevent<SPLIT>; And those he leaves<SPLIT>, to keep the city pent<SPLIT>.
Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore<SPLIT>: Some are by boats expos'd<SPLIT>, by bridges more<SPLIT>. With lab'ring oars they bear along the strand<SPLIT>, Where the tide languishes<SPLIT>, and leap aland<SPLIT>. Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, where no ford he finds<SPLIT>, no water fries<SPLIT>, Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar<SPLIT>, But smoothly slide along<SPLIT>, and swell the shore<SPLIT>, That course he steer'd<SPLIT>, and thus he gave command<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Here ply your oars<SPLIT>, and at all hazard land<SPLIT>: Force on the vessel<SPLIT>, that her keel may wound This hated soil<SPLIT>, and furrow hostile ground<SPLIT>. Let me securely land<SPLIT>- I ask no more<SPLIT>; Then sink my ships<SPLIT>, or shatter on the shore<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends<SPLIT>: They tug at ev'ry oar<SPLIT>, and ev'ry stretcher bends<SPLIT>; They run their ships aground<SPLIT>; the vessels knock<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Thus forc'd ashore<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) and tremble with the shock<SPLIT>. Tarchon<SPLIT>'s alone was lost<SPLIT>, that stranded stood<SPLIT>, Stuck on a bank<SPLIT>, and beaten by the flood<SPLIT>: She breaks her back<SPLIT>; the loosen'd sides give way<SPLIT>, And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea<SPLIT>. Their broken oars and floating planks withstand Their passage<SPLIT>, while they labor to the land<SPLIT>, And ebbing tides bear back upon th<SPLIT>' uncertain sand<SPLIT>.
Now Turnus leads his troops without delay<SPLIT>, Advancing to the margin of the sea<SPLIT>. The trumpets sound<SPLIT>: Aeneas first assail'd The clowns new-rais'd and raw<SPLIT>, and soon prevail'd<SPLIT>. Great Theron fell<SPLIT>, an omen of the fight<SPLIT>; Great Theron<SPLIT>, large of limbs<SPLIT>, of giant height<SPLIT>. He first in open field defied the prince<SPLIT>: But armor scal'd with gold was no defense Against the fated sword<SPLIT>, which open'd wide His plated shield<SPLIT>, and pierc'd his naked side<SPLIT>. Next<SPLIT>, Lichas fell<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, not like others born<SPLIT>, Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn<SPLIT>; Sacred<SPLIT>, O Phoebus<SPLIT>, from his birth to thee<SPLIT>; For his beginning life from biting steel was free<SPLIT>. Not far from him was Gyas laid along<SPLIT>, Of monstrous bulk<SPLIT>; with Cisseus fierce and strong<SPLIT>: Vain bulk and strength<SPLIT>! for<SPLIT>, when the chief assail'd<SPLIT>, Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail'd<SPLIT>, Nor their fam'd father<SPLIT>, wont in war to go With great Alcides<SPLIT>, while he toil'd below<SPLIT>. The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death<SPLIT>: Aeneas writh'd his dart<SPLIT>, and stopp'd his bawling breath<SPLIT>. Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom<SPLIT>, Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom<SPLIT>, And sought with lust obscene polluted joys<SPLIT>: The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys<SPLIT>, Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course Of the fierce champions<SPLIT>, with united force<SPLIT>. Sev'n darts were thrown at once<SPLIT>; and some rebound From his bright shield<SPLIT>, some on his helmet sound<SPLIT>: The rest had reach'd him<SPLIT>; but his mother<SPLIT>'s care Prevented those<SPLIT>, and turn'd aside in air<SPLIT>.
The prince then call'd Achates<SPLIT>, to supply The spears that knew the way to victory- "<SPLIT>Those fatal weapons<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, inur'd to blood<SPLIT>, In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood<SPLIT>: Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain Against our foes<SPLIT>, on this contended plain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; then seiz'd a mighty spear<SPLIT>, and threw<SPLIT>; Which<SPLIT>, wing'd with fate<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' Maeon<SPLIT>'s buckler flew<SPLIT>, Pierc'd all the brazen plates<SPLIT>, and reach'd his heart<SPLIT>: He stagger'd with intolerable smart<SPLIT>. Alcanor saw<SPLIT>; and reach'd<SPLIT>, but reach'd in vain<SPLIT>, His helping hand<SPLIT>, his brother to sustain<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>second spear<SPLIT>, which kept the former course<SPLIT>, From the same hand<SPLIT>, and sent with equal force<SPLIT>, His right arm pierc'd<SPLIT>, and holding on<SPLIT>, bereft His use of both<SPLIT>, and pinion'd down his left<SPLIT>. Then Numitor from his dead brother drew Th' ill-omen'd spear<SPLIT>, and at the Trojan threw<SPLIT>: Preventing fate directs the lance awry<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, glancing<SPLIT>, only mark'd Achates<SPLIT>' thigh<SPLIT>.
In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, from afar<SPLIT>, at Dryops took his aim<SPLIT>. The spear flew hissing thro<SPLIT>' the middle space<SPLIT>, And pierc'd his throat<SPLIT>, directed at his face<SPLIT>; It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind<SPLIT>, And the free soul to flitting air resign'd<SPLIT>: His forehead was the first that struck the ground<SPLIT>; Lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro<SPLIT>' the wound<SPLIT>. He slew three brothers of the Borean race<SPLIT>, And three<SPLIT>, whom Ismarus<SPLIT>, their native place<SPLIT>, Had sent to war<SPLIT>, but all the sons of Thrace<SPLIT>. Halesus<SPLIT>, next<SPLIT>, the bold Aurunci leads<SPLIT>: The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds<SPLIT>, Conspicuous on his horse<SPLIT>. On either hand<SPLIT>, These fight to keep<SPLIT>, and those to win<SPLIT>, the land<SPLIT>. With mutual blood th<SPLIT>' Ausonian soil is dyed<SPLIT>, While on its borders each their claim decide<SPLIT>. As wintry winds<SPLIT>, contending in the sky<SPLIT>, With equal force of lungs their titles try<SPLIT>: They rage<SPLIT>, they roar<SPLIT>; the doubtful rack of heav'n Stands without motion<SPLIT>, and the tide undriv'n<SPLIT>: Each bent to conquer<SPLIT>, neither side to yield<SPLIT>, They long suspend the fortune of the field<SPLIT>. Both armies thus perform what courage can<SPLIT>; Foot set to foot<SPLIT>, and mingled man to man<SPLIT>.
But<SPLIT>, in another part<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' Arcadian horse With ill success ingage the Latin force<SPLIT>: For<SPLIT>, where th<SPLIT>' impetuous torrent<SPLIT>, rushing down<SPLIT>, Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown<SPLIT>, They left their coursers<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, unus'd to fight On foot<SPLIT>, were scatter'd in a shameful flight<SPLIT>. Pallas<SPLIT>, who with disdain and grief had view'd His foes pursuing<SPLIT>, and his friends pursued<SPLIT>, Us'd threat<SPLIT>'nings mix'd with pray<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, his last resource<SPLIT>, With these to move their minds<SPLIT>, with those to fire their force "<SPLIT>Which way<SPLIT>, companions<SPLIT>? whether would you run<SPLIT>? By you yourselves<SPLIT>, and mighty battles won<SPLIT>, By my great sire<SPLIT>, by his establish'd name<SPLIT>, And early promise of my future fame<SPLIT>; By my youth<SPLIT>, emulous of equal right To share his honors<SPLIT>- shun ignoble flight<SPLIT>! Trust not your feet<SPLIT>: your hands must hew way Thro<SPLIT>' yon black body<SPLIT>, and that thick array<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>T is thro<SPLIT>' that forward path that we must come<SPLIT>; There lies our way<SPLIT>, and that our passage home<SPLIT>. Nor pow'rs above<SPLIT>, nor destinies below Oppress our arms<SPLIT>: with equal strength we go<SPLIT>, With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe<SPLIT>. See on what foot we stand<SPLIT>: a scanty shore<SPLIT>, The sea behind<SPLIT>, our enemies before<SPLIT>; No passage left<SPLIT>, unless we swim the main<SPLIT>; Or<SPLIT>, forcing these<SPLIT>, the Trojan trenches gain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This said<SPLIT>, he strode with eager haste along<SPLIT>, And bore amidst the thickest of the throng<SPLIT>. Lagus<SPLIT>, the first he met<SPLIT>, with fate to foe<SPLIT>, Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight<SPLIT>, to throw<SPLIT>: Stooping<SPLIT>, the spear descended on his chine<SPLIT>, Just where the bone distinguished either loin<SPLIT>: It stuck so fast<SPLIT>, so deeply buried lay<SPLIT>, That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away<SPLIT>. Hisbon came on<SPLIT>: but<SPLIT>, while he mov'd too slow To wish'd revenge<SPLIT>, the prince prevents his blow<SPLIT>; For<SPLIT>, warding his at once<SPLIT>, at once he press'd<SPLIT>, And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast<SPLIT>. Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust<SPLIT>, Who stain'd his stepdam<SPLIT>'s bed with impious lust<SPLIT>. And<SPLIT>, after him<SPLIT>, the Daucian twins were slain<SPLIT>, Laris and Thymbrus<SPLIT>, on the Latian plain<SPLIT>; So wondrous like in feature<SPLIT>, shape<SPLIT>, and size<SPLIT>, As caus'd an error in their parents<SPLIT>' eyes<SPLIT>- Grateful mistake<SPLIT>! but soon the sword decides The nice distinction<SPLIT>, and their fate divides<SPLIT>: For Thymbrus<SPLIT>' head was lopp'd<SPLIT>; and Laris<SPLIT>' hand<SPLIT>, Dismember'd<SPLIT>, sought its owner on the strand<SPLIT>: The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain<SPLIT>, And threaten still th<SPLIT>' intended stroke in vain<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, to renew the charge<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' Arcadians came<SPLIT>: Sight of such acts<SPLIT>, and sense of honest shame<SPLIT>, And grief<SPLIT>, with anger mix'd<SPLIT>, their minds inflame<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain<SPLIT>, Who chanc'd<SPLIT>, as Pallas threw<SPLIT>, to cross the plain<SPLIT>: The flying spear was after Ilus sent<SPLIT>; But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant<SPLIT>: From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled<SPLIT>, The lance<SPLIT>, athwart his body<SPLIT>, laid him dead<SPLIT>: Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound<SPLIT>, And intercepted fate<SPLIT>, he spurn'd the ground<SPLIT>. As when<SPLIT>, in summer<SPLIT>, welcome winds arise<SPLIT>, The watchful shepherd to the forest flies<SPLIT>, And fires the midmost plants<SPLIT>; contagion spreads<SPLIT>, And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads<SPLIT>; Around the forest flies the furious blast<SPLIT>, And all the leafy nation sinks at last<SPLIT>, And Vulcan rides in triumph o<SPLIT>'er the waste<SPLIT>; The pastor<SPLIT>, pleas'd with his dire victory<SPLIT>, Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky<SPLIT>: So Pallas<SPLIT>' troops their scatter'd strength unite<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, pouring on their foes<SPLIT>, their prince delight<SPLIT>.
Halesus came<SPLIT>, fierce with desire of blood<SPLIT>; But first collected in his arms he stood<SPLIT>: Advancing then<SPLIT>, he plied the spear so well<SPLIT>, Ladon<SPLIT>, Demodocus<SPLIT>, and Pheres fell<SPLIT>. Around his head he toss'd his glitt<SPLIT>'ring brand<SPLIT>, And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand<SPLIT>, Held up to guard his throat<SPLIT>; then hurl'd a stone At Thoas<SPLIT>' ample front<SPLIT>, and pierc'd the bone<SPLIT>: It struck beneath the space of either eye<SPLIT>; And blood<SPLIT>, and mingled brains<SPLIT>, together fly<SPLIT>. Deep skill'd in future fates<SPLIT>, Halesus<SPLIT>' sire Did with the youth to lonely groves retire<SPLIT>: But<SPLIT>, when the father<SPLIT>'s mortal race was run<SPLIT>, Dire destiny laid hold upon the son<SPLIT>, And haul'd him to the war<SPLIT>, to find<SPLIT>, beneath Th' Evandrian spear<SPLIT>, a memorable death<SPLIT>. Pallas th<SPLIT>' encounter seeks<SPLIT>, but<SPLIT>, ere he throws<SPLIT>, To Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O sacred stream<SPLIT>, direct my flying dart<SPLIT>, And give to pass the proud Halesus<SPLIT>' heart<SPLIT>! His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Pleas'd with the bribe<SPLIT>, the god receiv'd his pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>: For<SPLIT>, while his shield protects a friend distress'd<SPLIT>, The dart came driving on<SPLIT>, and pierc'd his breast<SPLIT>.
But Lausus<SPLIT>, no small portion of the war<SPLIT>, Permits not panic fear to reign too far<SPLIT>, Caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight<SPLIT>; But by his own example cheers the fight<SPLIT>. Fierce Abas first he slew<SPLIT>; Abas<SPLIT>, the stay Of Trojan hopes<SPLIT>, and hindrance of the day<SPLIT>. The Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain<SPLIT>: They<SPLIT>, and their mix'd allies<SPLIT>, now load the plain<SPLIT>. To the rude shock of war both armies came<SPLIT>; Their leaders equal<SPLIT>, and their strength the same<SPLIT>. The rear so press'd the front<SPLIT>, they could not wield Their angry weapons<SPLIT>, to dispute the field<SPLIT>. Here Pallas urges on<SPLIT>, and Lausus there<SPLIT>: Of equal youth and beauty both appear<SPLIT>, But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air<SPLIT>. Their congress in the field great Jove withstands<SPLIT>: Both doom'd to fall<SPLIT>, but fall by greater hands<SPLIT>.
Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief Of Lausus<SPLIT>' danger<SPLIT>, urging swift relief<SPLIT>. With his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, making to his friends<SPLIT>, thus calls aloud<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Let none presume his needless aid to join<SPLIT>; Retire<SPLIT>, and clear the field<SPLIT>; the fight is mine<SPLIT>: To this right hand is Pallas only due<SPLIT>; O<SPLIT>were his father here<SPLIT>, my just revenge to view<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" From the forbidden space his men retir'd<SPLIT>. Pallas their awe<SPLIT>, and his stern words<SPLIT>, admir'd<SPLIT>; Survey'd him o<SPLIT>'er and o<SPLIT>'er with wond<SPLIT>'ring sight<SPLIT>, Struck with his haughty mien<SPLIT>, and tow'ring height<SPLIT>. Then to the king<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Your empty vaunts forbear<SPLIT>; Success I hope<SPLIT>, and fate I cannot fear<SPLIT>; Alive or dead<SPLIT>, I shall deserve a name<SPLIT>; Jove is impartial<SPLIT>, and to both the same<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and to the void advanc'd his pace<SPLIT>: Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face<SPLIT>. Then Turnus<SPLIT>, from his chariot leaping light<SPLIT>, Address'd himself on foot to single fight<SPLIT>. And<SPLIT>, as a lion<SPLIT>- when he spies from far A<SPLIT>bull that seems to meditate the war<SPLIT>, Bending his neck<SPLIT>, and spurning back the sand<SPLIT>- Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand<SPLIT>: Imagine eager Turnus not more slow<SPLIT>, To rush from high on his unequal foe<SPLIT>.
Young Pallas<SPLIT>, when he saw the chief advance Within due distance of his flying lance<SPLIT>, Prepares to charge him first<SPLIT>, resolv'd to try If fortune would his want of force supply<SPLIT>; And thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Alcides<SPLIT>, once on earth Evander<SPLIT>'s guest<SPLIT>, His son adjures you by those holy rites<SPLIT>, That hospitable board<SPLIT>, those genial nights<SPLIT>; Assist my great attempt to gain this prize<SPLIT>, And let proud Turnus view<SPLIT>, with dying eyes<SPLIT>, His ravish'd spoils<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" '<SPLIT>T was heard<SPLIT>, the vain request<SPLIT>; Alcides mourn'd<SPLIT>, and stifled sighs within his breast<SPLIT>. Then Jove<SPLIT>, to soothe his sorrow<SPLIT>, thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Short bounds of life are set to mortal man<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is virtue<SPLIT>'s work alone to stretch the narrow span<SPLIT>. So many sons of gods<SPLIT>, in bloody fight<SPLIT>, Around the walls of Troy<SPLIT>, have lost the light<SPLIT>: My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe<SPLIT>; Nor I<SPLIT>, his mighty sire<SPLIT>, could ward the blow<SPLIT>. Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath<SPLIT>, And stands already on the verge of death<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This said<SPLIT>, the god permits the fatal fight<SPLIT>, But from the Latian fields averts his sight<SPLIT>.
Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, having thrown<SPLIT>, his shining fauchion drew The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint<SPLIT>, And mark'd it slightly with the glancing point<SPLIT>, Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew<SPLIT>, And pois'd his pointed spear<SPLIT>, before he threw<SPLIT>: Then<SPLIT>, as the winged weapon whizz'd along<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>See now<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "whose arm is better strung<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The spear kept on the fatal course<SPLIT>, unstay'd By plates of ir<SPLIT>'n<SPLIT>, which o<SPLIT>'er the shield were laid<SPLIT>: Thro<SPLIT>' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd<SPLIT>, His corslet pierc'd<SPLIT>, and reach'd his heart at last<SPLIT>. In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood<SPLIT>; The soul comes issuing with the vital blood<SPLIT>: He falls<SPLIT>; his arms upon his body sound<SPLIT>; And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground<SPLIT>.
Turnus bestrode the corpse<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Arcadians<SPLIT>, hear<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" Said he<SPLIT>; "my message to your master bear<SPLIT>: Such as the sire deserv'd<SPLIT>, the son I send<SPLIT>; It costs him dear to be the Phrygians<SPLIT>' friend<SPLIT>. The lifeless body<SPLIT>, tell him<SPLIT>, I bestow<SPLIT>, Unask'd<SPLIT>, to rest his wand<SPLIT>'ring ghost below<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and trampled down with all the force Of his left foot<SPLIT>, and spurn'd the wretched corse<SPLIT>; Then snatch'd the shining belt<SPLIT>, with gold inlaid<SPLIT>; The belt Eurytion<SPLIT>'s artful hands had made<SPLIT>, Where fifty fatal brides<SPLIT>, express'd to sight<SPLIT>, All in the compass of one mournful night<SPLIT>, Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light<SPLIT>.
In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore Those golden spoils<SPLIT>, and in a worse he wore<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>mortals<SPLIT>, blind in fate<SPLIT>, who never know To bear high fortune<SPLIT>, or endure the low<SPLIT>! The time shall come<SPLIT>, when Turnus<SPLIT>, but in vain<SPLIT>, Shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain<SPLIT>; Shall wish the fatal belt were far away<SPLIT>, And curse the dire remembrance of the day<SPLIT>.
The sad Arcadians<SPLIT>, from th<SPLIT>' unhappy field<SPLIT>, Bear back the breathless body on a shield<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>grace and grief of war<SPLIT>! at once restor'd<SPLIT>, With praises<SPLIT>, to thy sire<SPLIT>, at once deplor'd<SPLIT>! One day first sent thee to the fighting field<SPLIT>, Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd<SPLIT>; One day beheld thee dead<SPLIT>, and borne upon thy shield<SPLIT>. This dismal news<SPLIT>, not from uncertain fame<SPLIT>, But sad spectators<SPLIT>, to the hero came<SPLIT>: His friends upon the brink of ruin stand<SPLIT>, Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand<SPLIT>. He whirls his sword around<SPLIT>, without delay<SPLIT>, And hews thro<SPLIT>' adverse foes an ample way<SPLIT>, To find fierce Turnus<SPLIT>, of his conquest proud<SPLIT>: Evander<SPLIT>, Pallas<SPLIT>, all that friendship ow'd To large deserts<SPLIT>, are present to his eyes<SPLIT>; His plighted hand<SPLIT>, and hospitable ties<SPLIT>.
Four sons of Sulmo<SPLIT>, four whom Ufens bred<SPLIT>, He took in fight<SPLIT>, and living victims led<SPLIT>, To please the ghost of Pallas<SPLIT>, and expire<SPLIT>, In sacrifice<SPLIT>, before his fun'ral fire<SPLIT>. At Magus next he threw<SPLIT>: he stoop'd below The flying spear<SPLIT>, and shunn'd the promis'd blow<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, creeping<SPLIT>, clasp'd the hero<SPLIT>'s knees<SPLIT>, and pray'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>By young Iulus<SPLIT>, by thy father<SPLIT>'s shade<SPLIT>, O<SPLIT>spare my life<SPLIT>, and send me back to see My longing sire<SPLIT>, and tender progeny<SPLIT>! A<SPLIT>lofty house I have<SPLIT>, and wealth untold<SPLIT>, In silver ingots<SPLIT>, and in bars of gold<SPLIT>: All these<SPLIT>, and sums besides<SPLIT>, which see no day<SPLIT>, The ransom of this one poor life shall pay<SPLIT>. If I survive<SPLIT>, will Troy the less prevail<SPLIT>? A<SPLIT>single soul<SPLIT>'s too light to turn the scale<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>. The hero sternly thus replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Thy bars and ingots<SPLIT>, and the sums beside<SPLIT>, Leave for thy children<SPLIT>'s lot<SPLIT>. Thy Turnus broke All rules of war by one relentless stroke<SPLIT>, When Pallas fell<SPLIT>: so deems<SPLIT>, nor deems alone My father<SPLIT>'s shadow<SPLIT>, but my living son<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus having said<SPLIT>, of kind remorse bereft<SPLIT>, He seiz'd his helm<SPLIT>, and dragg'd him with his left<SPLIT>; Then with his right hand<SPLIT>, while his neck he wreath'd<SPLIT>, Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd<SPLIT>.
Apollo<SPLIT>'s priest<SPLIT>, Emonides<SPLIT>, was near<SPLIT>; His holy fillets on his front appear<SPLIT>; Glitt<SPLIT>'ring in arms<SPLIT>, he shone amidst the crowd<SPLIT>; Much of his god<SPLIT>, more of his purple<SPLIT>, proud<SPLIT>. Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro<SPLIT>' the field<SPLIT>: The holy coward fell<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, forc'd to yield<SPLIT>, The prince stood o<SPLIT>'er the priest<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, at one blow<SPLIT>, Sent him an off'ring to the shades below<SPLIT>. His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears<SPLIT>, Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars<SPLIT>.
Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight<SPLIT>, And Umbro<SPLIT>, born upon the mountains<SPLIT>' height<SPLIT>. The champion cheers his troops t<SPLIT>' encounter those<SPLIT>, And seeks revenge himself on other foes<SPLIT>. At Anxur<SPLIT>'s shield he drove<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, at the blow<SPLIT>, Both shield and arm to ground together go<SPLIT>. Anxur had boasted much of magic charms<SPLIT>, And thought he wore impenetrable arms<SPLIT>, So made by mutter'd spells<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, from the spheres<SPLIT>, Had life secur'd<SPLIT>, in vain<SPLIT>, for length of years<SPLIT>. Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>nymph his mother<SPLIT>, his sire a god<SPLIT>. Exulting in bright arms<SPLIT>, he braves the prince<SPLIT>: With his protended lance he makes defense<SPLIT>; Bears back his feeble foe<SPLIT>; then<SPLIT>, pressing on<SPLIT>, Arrests his better hand<SPLIT>, and drags him down<SPLIT>; Stands o<SPLIT>'er the prostrate wretch<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, as he lay<SPLIT>, Vain tales inventing<SPLIT>, and prepar'd to pray<SPLIT>, Mows off his head<SPLIT>: the trunk a moment stood<SPLIT>, Then sunk<SPLIT>, and roll'd along the sand in blood<SPLIT>. The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Lie there<SPLIT>, proud man<SPLIT>, unpitied<SPLIT>, on the plain<SPLIT>; Lie there<SPLIT>, inglorious<SPLIT>, and without a tomb<SPLIT>, Far from thy mother and thy native home<SPLIT>, Exposed to savage beasts<SPLIT>, and birds of prey<SPLIT>, Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran<SPLIT>, Two chiefs of Turnus<SPLIT>, and who led his van<SPLIT>. They fled for fear<SPLIT>; with these<SPLIT>, he chas'd along Camers the yellow-lock'd<SPLIT>, and Numa strong<SPLIT>; Both great in arms<SPLIT>, and both were fair and young<SPLIT>. Camers was son to Volscens lately slain<SPLIT>, In wealth surpassing all the Latian train<SPLIT>, And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign<SPLIT>. And<SPLIT>, as Aegaeon<SPLIT>, when with heav'n he strove<SPLIT>, Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove<SPLIT>; Mov'd all his hundred hands<SPLIT>, provok'd the war<SPLIT>, Defied the forky lightning from afar<SPLIT>; At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires<SPLIT>, And flash for flash returns<SPLIT>, and fires for fires<SPLIT>; In his right hand as many swords he wields<SPLIT>, And takes the thunder on as many shields<SPLIT>: With strength like his<SPLIT>, the Trojan hero stood<SPLIT>; And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd<SPLIT>, When once his fauchion found the taste of blood<SPLIT>. With fury scarce to be conceiv'd<SPLIT>, he flew Against Niphaeus<SPLIT>, whom four coursers drew<SPLIT>. They<SPLIT>, when they see the fiery chief advance<SPLIT>, And pushing at their chests his pointed lance<SPLIT>, Wheel'd with so swift a motion<SPLIT>, mad with fear<SPLIT>, They threw their master headlong from the chair<SPLIT>. They stare<SPLIT>, they start<SPLIT>, nor stop their course<SPLIT>, before They bear the bounding chariot to the shore<SPLIT>.
Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains<SPLIT>, With two white steeds<SPLIT>; but Liger holds the reins<SPLIT>, And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains<SPLIT>: Bold brethren both<SPLIT>. The former wav'd in air His flaming sword<SPLIT>: Aeneas couch'd his spear<SPLIT>, Unus'd to threats<SPLIT>, and more unus'd to fear<SPLIT>. Then Liger thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Thy confidence is vain To scape from hence<SPLIT>, as from the Trojan plain<SPLIT>: Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode<SPLIT>, Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode<SPLIT>; Nor Venus<SPLIT>' veil is here<SPLIT>, near Neptune<SPLIT>'s shield<SPLIT>; Thy fatal hour is come<SPLIT>, and this the field<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus Liger vainly vaunts<SPLIT>: the Trojan peer Return'd his answer with his flying spear<SPLIT>. As Lucagus<SPLIT>, to lash his horses<SPLIT>, bends<SPLIT>, Prone to the wheels<SPLIT>, and his left foot protends<SPLIT>, Prepar'd for fight<SPLIT>; the fatal dart arrives<SPLIT>, And thro<SPLIT>' the borders of his buckler drives<SPLIT>; Pass'd thro<SPLIT>' and pierc'd his groin<SPLIT>: the deadly wound<SPLIT>, Cast from his chariot<SPLIT>, roll'd him on the ground<SPLIT>. Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight<SPLIT>; Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat<SPLIT>; But you yourself forsake your empty seat<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein<SPLIT>; For Liger lay already on the plain<SPLIT>, By the same shock<SPLIT>: then<SPLIT>, stretching out his hands<SPLIT>, The recreant thus his wretched life demands<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Now<SPLIT>, by thyself<SPLIT>, O more than mortal man<SPLIT>! By her and him from whom thy breath began<SPLIT>, Who form'd thee thus divine<SPLIT>, I beg thee<SPLIT>, spare This forfeit life<SPLIT>, and hear thy suppliant<SPLIT>'s pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Thus much he spoke<SPLIT>, and more he would have said<SPLIT>; But the stern hero turn'd aside his head<SPLIT>, And cut him short<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>I hear another man<SPLIT>; You talk'd not thus before the fight began<SPLIT>. Now take your turn<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, as a brother should<SPLIT>, Attend your brother to the Stygian flood<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then thro<SPLIT>' his breast his fatal sword he sent<SPLIT>, And the soul issued at the gaping vent<SPLIT>.
As storms the skies<SPLIT>, and torrents tear the ground<SPLIT>, Thus rag'd the prince<SPLIT>, and scatter'd deaths around<SPLIT>. At length Ascanius and the Trojan train Broke from the camp<SPLIT>, so long besieg'd in vain<SPLIT>.
Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man Held conference with his queen<SPLIT>, and thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>My sister goddess<SPLIT>, and well-pleasing wife<SPLIT>, Still think you Venus<SPLIT>' aid supports the strife- Sustains her Trojans<SPLIT>- or themselves<SPLIT>, alone<SPLIT>, With inborn valor force their fortune on<SPLIT>? How fierce in fight<SPLIT>, with courage undecay'd<SPLIT>! Judge if such warriors want immortal aid<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" To whom the goddess with the charming eyes<SPLIT>, Soft in her tone<SPLIT>, submissively replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Why<SPLIT>, O my sov'reign lord<SPLIT>, whose frown I fear<SPLIT>, And cannot<SPLIT>, unconcer<SPLIT>n'd<SPLIT>, your anger bear<SPLIT>; Why urge you thus my grief<SPLIT>? when<SPLIT>, if I still (<SPLIT>As once I was<SPLIT>) were mistress of your will<SPLIT>, From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus<SPLIT>' life<SPLIT>, Securely snatch him from the fatal fight<SPLIT>, And give him to his aged father<SPLIT>'s sight<SPLIT>. Now let him perish<SPLIT>, since you hold it good<SPLIT>, And glut the Trojans with his pious blood<SPLIT>. Yet from our lineage he derives his name<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, in the fourth degree<SPLIT>, from god Pilumnus came<SPLIT>; Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine<SPLIT>, And offers daily incense at your shrine<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide<SPLIT>, If for a little space<SPLIT>, a lengthen'd span<SPLIT>, You beg reprieve for this expiring man<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>grant you leave to take your Turnus hence From instant fate<SPLIT>, and can so far dispense<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, if some secret meaning lies beneath<SPLIT>, To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death<SPLIT>, Or if a farther thought you entertain<SPLIT>, To change the fates<SPLIT>; you feed your hopes in vain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" To whom the goddess thus<SPLIT>, with weeping eyes<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>And what if that request<SPLIT>, your tongue denies<SPLIT>, Your heart should grant<SPLIT>; and not a short reprieve<SPLIT>, But length of certain life<SPLIT>, to Turnus give<SPLIT>? Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth<SPLIT>, If my presaging soul divines with truth<SPLIT>; Which<SPLIT>, O<SPLIT>! I wish<SPLIT>, might err thro<SPLIT>' causeless fears<SPLIT>, And you (<SPLIT>for you have pow'r<SPLIT>) prolong his years<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
Thus having said<SPLIT>, involv'd in clouds<SPLIT>, she flies<SPLIT>, And drives a storm before her thro<SPLIT>' the skies<SPLIT>. Swift she descends<SPLIT>, alighting on the plain<SPLIT>, Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain<SPLIT>. Of air condens'd a specter soon she made<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, what Aeneas was<SPLIT>, such seem'd the shade<SPLIT>. Adorn'd with Dardan arms<SPLIT>, the phantom bore His head aloft<SPLIT>; a plumy crest he wore<SPLIT>; This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield<SPLIT>, And that sustain'd an imitated shield<SPLIT>. With manly mien he stalk'd along the ground<SPLIT>, Nor wanted voice belied<SPLIT>, nor vaunting sound<SPLIT>. (<SPLIT>Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight<SPLIT>, Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>) The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare<SPLIT>, And flourishes his empty sword in air<SPLIT>. At this<SPLIT>, advancing<SPLIT>, Turnus hurl'd his spear<SPLIT>: The phantom wheel'd<SPLIT>, and seem'd to fly for fear<SPLIT>. Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled<SPLIT>, And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Whether<SPLIT>, O coward<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" (<SPLIT>thus he calls aloud<SPLIT>, Nor found he spoke to wind<SPLIT>, and chas'd a cloud<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) "<SPLIT>Why thus forsake your bride<SPLIT>! Receive from me The fated land you sought so long by sea<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, brandishing at once his blade<SPLIT>, With eager pace pursued the flying shade<SPLIT>. By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore<SPLIT>, Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore<SPLIT>: The plank was ready laid for safe ascent<SPLIT>; For shelter there the trembling shadow bent<SPLIT>, And skipp't and skulk'd<SPLIT>, and under hatches went<SPLIT>. Exulting Turnus<SPLIT>, with regardless haste<SPLIT>, Ascends the plank<SPLIT>, and to the galley pass'd<SPLIT>. Scarce had he reach'd the prow<SPLIT>: Saturnia<SPLIT>'s hand The haulsers cuts<SPLIT>, and shoots the ship from land<SPLIT>. With wind in poop<SPLIT>, the vessel plows the sea<SPLIT>, And measures back with speed her former way<SPLIT>. Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe<SPLIT>, And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below<SPLIT>.
The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud<SPLIT>, And flew sublime<SPLIT>, and vanish'd in a cloud<SPLIT>. Too late young Turnus the delusion found<SPLIT>, Far on the sea<SPLIT>, still making from the ground<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame<SPLIT>, With sense of honor stung<SPLIT>, and forfeit fame<SPLIT>, Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd<SPLIT>, His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast<SPLIT>; "<SPLIT>O Jove<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" he cried<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>for what offense have Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy<SPLIT>? Whence am I forc'd<SPLIT>, and whether am I borne<SPLIT>? How<SPLIT>, and with what reproach<SPLIT>, shall I return<SPLIT>? Shall ever I behold the Latian plain<SPLIT>, Or see Laurentum<SPLIT>'s lofty tow'rs again<SPLIT>? What will they say of their deserting chief The war was mine<SPLIT>: I fly from their relief<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>led to slaughter<SPLIT>, and in slaughter leave<SPLIT>; And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive<SPLIT>. Here<SPLIT>, overmatch'd in fight<SPLIT>, in heaps they lie<SPLIT>; There<SPLIT>, scatter'd o<SPLIT>'er the fields<SPLIT>, ignobly fly<SPLIT>. Gape wide<SPLIT>, O earth<SPLIT>, and draw me down alive<SPLIT>! Or<SPLIT>, O ye pitying winds<SPLIT>, a wretch relieve<SPLIT>! On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive<SPLIT>; Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore<SPLIT>, Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more<SPLIT>, Unknown to friends<SPLIT>, or foes<SPLIT>, or conscious Fame<SPLIT>, Lest she should follow<SPLIT>, and my flight proclaim<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus Turnus rav'd<SPLIT>, and various fates revolv'd<SPLIT>: The choice was doubtful<SPLIT>, but the death resolv'd<SPLIT>. And now the sword<SPLIT>, and now the sea took place<SPLIT>, That to revenge<SPLIT>, and this to purge disgrace<SPLIT>. Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main<SPLIT>, By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain<SPLIT>. Thrice he the sword assay'd<SPLIT>, and thrice the flood<SPLIT>; But Juno<SPLIT>, mov'd with pity<SPLIT>, both withstood<SPLIT>. And thrice repress'd his rage<SPLIT>; strong gales supplied<SPLIT>, And push'd the vessel o<SPLIT>'er the swelling tide<SPLIT>. At length she lands him on his native shores<SPLIT>, And to his father<SPLIT>'s longing arms restores<SPLIT>.
Meantime<SPLIT>, by Jove<SPLIT>'s impulse<SPLIT>, Mezentius arm'd<SPLIT>, Succeeding Turnus<SPLIT>, with his ardor warm'd His fainting friends<SPLIT>, reproach'd their shameful flight<SPLIT>, Repell'd the victors<SPLIT>, and renew'd the fight<SPLIT>. Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire<SPLIT>; Such is their hate<SPLIT>, and such their fierce desire Of wish'd revenge<SPLIT>: on him<SPLIT>, and him alone<SPLIT>, All hands employ'd<SPLIT>, and all their darts are thrown<SPLIT>. He<SPLIT>, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd<SPLIT>, To raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd<SPLIT>, From his proud summit looking down<SPLIT>, disdains Their empty menace<SPLIT>, and unmov'd remains<SPLIT>.
Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead<SPLIT>, Then Latagus<SPLIT>, and Palmus as he fled<SPLIT>. At Latagus a weighty stone he flung<SPLIT>: His face was flatted<SPLIT>, and his helmet rung<SPLIT>. But Palmus from behind receives his wound<SPLIT>; Hamstring'd he falls<SPLIT>, and grovels on the ground<SPLIT>: His crest and armor<SPLIT>, from his body torn<SPLIT>, Thy shoulders<SPLIT>, Lausus<SPLIT>, and thy head adorn<SPLIT>. Evas and Mimas<SPLIT>, both of Troy<SPLIT>, he slew<SPLIT>. Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew<SPLIT>, Born on that fatal night<SPLIT>, when<SPLIT>, big with fire<SPLIT>, The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire<SPLIT>: But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain<SPLIT>, Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain<SPLIT>.
And<SPLIT>, as a savage boar<SPLIT>, on mountains bred<SPLIT>, With forest mast and fatt<SPLIT>'ning marshes fed<SPLIT>, When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd<SPLIT>, By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd<SPLIT>- He whets his tusks<SPLIT>, and turns<SPLIT>, and dares the war<SPLIT>; Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar<SPLIT>: All keep aloof<SPLIT>, and safely shout around<SPLIT>; But none presumes to give a nearer wound<SPLIT>: He frets and froths<SPLIT>, erects his bristled hide<SPLIT>, And shakes a grove of lances from his side<SPLIT>: Not otherwise the troops<SPLIT>, with hate inspir'd<SPLIT>, And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd<SPLIT>, Their darts with clamor at a distance drive<SPLIT>, And only keep the languish'd war alive<SPLIT>.
From Coritus came Acron to the fight<SPLIT>, Who left his spouse betroth'd<SPLIT>, and unconsummate night<SPLIT>. Mezentius sees him thro<SPLIT>' the squadrons ride<SPLIT>, Proud of the purple favors of his bride<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, as a hungry lion<SPLIT>, who beholds A<SPLIT>gamesome goat<SPLIT>, who frisks about the folds<SPLIT>, Or beamy stag<SPLIT>, that grazes on the plain- He runs<SPLIT>, he roars<SPLIT>, he shakes his rising mane<SPLIT>, He grins<SPLIT>, and opens wide his greedy jaws<SPLIT>; The prey lies panting underneath his paws<SPLIT>: He fills his famish'd maw<SPLIT>; his mouth runs o<SPLIT>'er With unchew'd morsels<SPLIT>, while he churns the gore<SPLIT>: So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes<SPLIT>, And first unhappy Acron overthrows<SPLIT>: Stretch'd at his length<SPLIT>, he spurns the swarthy ground<SPLIT>; The lance<SPLIT>, besmear'd with blood<SPLIT>, lies broken in the wound<SPLIT>. Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd Orodes flying<SPLIT>, nor the wretch pursued<SPLIT>, Nor thought the dastard<SPLIT>'s back deserv'd a wound<SPLIT>, But<SPLIT>, running<SPLIT>, gain'd th<SPLIT>' advantage of the ground<SPLIT>: Then turning short<SPLIT>, he met him face to face<SPLIT>, To give his victor the better grace<SPLIT>. Orodes falls<SPLIT>, in equal fight oppress'd<SPLIT>: Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast<SPLIT>, And rested lance<SPLIT>; and thus aloud he cries<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" The fields around with Io Paean<SPLIT>! ring<SPLIT>; And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king<SPLIT>. At this the vanquish'd<SPLIT>, with his dying breath<SPLIT>, Thus faintly spoke<SPLIT>, and prophesied in death<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Nor thou<SPLIT>, proud man<SPLIT>, unpunish'd shalt remain<SPLIT>: Like death attends thee on this fatal plain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then<SPLIT>, sourly smiling<SPLIT>, thus the king replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>For what belongs to me<SPLIT>, let Jove provide<SPLIT>; But die thou first<SPLIT>, whatever chance ensue<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and from the wound the weapon drew<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>hov'ring mist came swimming o<SPLIT>'er his sight<SPLIT>, And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night<SPLIT>.
By Caedicus<SPLIT>, Alcathous was slain<SPLIT>; Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain<SPLIT>; Orses the strong to greater strength must yield<SPLIT>; He<SPLIT>, with Parthenius<SPLIT>, were by Rapo kill'd<SPLIT>. Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew<SPLIT>, Who from Lycaon<SPLIT>'s blood his lineage drew<SPLIT>. But from his headstrong horse his fate he found<SPLIT>, Who threw his master<SPLIT>, as he made a bound<SPLIT>: The chief<SPLIT>, alighting<SPLIT>, stuck him to the ground<SPLIT>; Then Clonius<SPLIT>, hand to hand<SPLIT>, on foot assails<SPLIT>: The Trojan sinks<SPLIT>, and Neptune<SPLIT>'s son prevails<SPLIT>. Agis the Lycian<SPLIT>, stepping forth with pride<SPLIT>, To single fight the boldest foe defied<SPLIT>; Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o<SPLIT>'ercame<SPLIT>, And not belied his mighty father<SPLIT>'s fame<SPLIT>. Salius to death the great Antronius sent<SPLIT>: But the same fate the victor underwent<SPLIT>, Slain by Nealces<SPLIT>' hand<SPLIT>, well-skill'd to throw The flying dart<SPLIT>, and draw the far-deceiving bow<SPLIT>.
Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance<SPLIT>; By turns they quit their ground<SPLIT>, by turns advance<SPLIT>: Victors and vanquish'd<SPLIT>, in the various field<SPLIT>, Nor wholly overcome<SPLIT>, nor wholly yield<SPLIT>. The gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife<SPLIT>, And mourn the miseries of human life<SPLIT>. Above the rest<SPLIT>, two goddesses appear Concer<SPLIT>n'd for each<SPLIT>: here Venus<SPLIT>, Juno there<SPLIT>. Amidst the crowd<SPLIT>, infernal Ate shakes Her scourge aloft<SPLIT>, and crest of hissing snakes<SPLIT>.
Once more the proud Mezentius<SPLIT>, with disdain<SPLIT>, Brandish'd his spear<SPLIT>, and rush'd into the plain<SPLIT>, Where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood<SPLIT>, Like tall Orion stalking o<SPLIT>'er the flood<SPLIT>. (<SPLIT>When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves<SPLIT>, His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>, Or like a mountain ash<SPLIT>, whose roots are spread<SPLIT>, Deep fix'd in earth<SPLIT>; in clouds he hides his head<SPLIT>.
The Trojan prince beheld him from afar<SPLIT>, And dauntless undertook the doubtful war<SPLIT>. Collected in his strength<SPLIT>, and like a rock<SPLIT>, Pois'd on his base<SPLIT>, Mezentius stood the shock<SPLIT>. He stood<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, measuring first with careful eyes The space his spear could reach<SPLIT>, aloud he cries<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>My strong right hand<SPLIT>, and sword<SPLIT>, assist my stroke<SPLIT>! (<SPLIT>Those only gods Mezentius will invoke<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>) His armor<SPLIT>, from the Trojan pirate torn<SPLIT>, By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and with his utmost force he threw The massy spear<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, hissing as it flew<SPLIT>, Reach'd the celestial shield<SPLIT>, that stopp'd the course<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, glancing thence<SPLIT>, the yet unbroken force Took a new bent obliquely<SPLIT>, and betwixt The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd<SPLIT>. Anthores had from Argos travel'd far<SPLIT>, Alcides<SPLIT>' friend<SPLIT>, and brother of the war<SPLIT>; Till<SPLIT>, tir'd with toils<SPLIT>, fair Italy he chose<SPLIT>, And in Evander<SPLIT>'s palace sought repose<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, falling by another<SPLIT>'s wound<SPLIT>, his eyes He cast to heav'n<SPLIT>, on Argos thinks<SPLIT>, and dies<SPLIT>.
The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent<SPLIT>; The shield gave way<SPLIT>; thro<SPLIT>' treble plates it went Of solid brass<SPLIT>, of linen trebly roll'd<SPLIT>, And three bull hides which round the buckler fold<SPLIT>. All these it pass'd<SPLIT>, resistless in the course<SPLIT>, Transpierc'd his thigh<SPLIT>, and spent its dying force<SPLIT>. The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood<SPLIT>. The Trojan<SPLIT>, glad with sight of hostile blood<SPLIT>, His faunchion drew<SPLIT>, to closer fight address'd<SPLIT>, And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd<SPLIT>.
His father<SPLIT>'s peril Lausus view'd with grief<SPLIT>; He sigh'd<SPLIT>, he wept<SPLIT>, he ran to his relief<SPLIT>. And here<SPLIT>, heroic youth<SPLIT>, 't is here I must To thy immortal memory be just<SPLIT>, And sing an act so noble and so new<SPLIT>, Posterity will scarce believe 't is true<SPLIT>. Pain'd with his wound<SPLIT>, and useless for the fight<SPLIT>, The father sought to save himself by flight<SPLIT>: Incumber'd<SPLIT>, slow he dragg'd the spear along<SPLIT>, Which pierc'd his thigh<SPLIT>, and in his buckler hung<SPLIT>. The pious youth<SPLIT>, resolv'd on death<SPLIT>, below The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe<SPLIT>; Protects his parent<SPLIT>, and prevents the blow<SPLIT>. Shouts of applause ran ringing thro<SPLIT>' the field<SPLIT>, To see the son the vanquish'd father shield<SPLIT>. All<SPLIT>, fir'd with gen'rous indignation<SPLIT>, strive<SPLIT>, And with a storm of darts to distance drive The Trojan chief<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, held at bay from far<SPLIT>, On his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war<SPLIT>.
As<SPLIT>, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind<SPLIT>, The plowman<SPLIT>, passenger<SPLIT>, and lab'ring hind For shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly<SPLIT>, Or hous'd<SPLIT>, or safe in hollow caverns lie<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, that o<SPLIT>'erblown<SPLIT>, when heav'n above 'em smiles<SPLIT>, Return to travel<SPLIT>, and renew their toils<SPLIT>: Aeneas thus<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'erwhelmed on ev'ry side<SPLIT>, The storm of darts<SPLIT>, undaunted<SPLIT>, did abide<SPLIT>; And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat<SPLIT>'ning cried<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Why wilt thou rush to certain death<SPLIT>, and rage In rash attempts<SPLIT>, beyond thy tender age<SPLIT>, Betray'd by pious love<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" Nor<SPLIT>, thus forborne<SPLIT>, The youth desists<SPLIT>, but with insulting scorn Provokes the ling<SPLIT>'ring prince<SPLIT>, whose patience<SPLIT>, tir'd<SPLIT>, Gave place<SPLIT>; and all his breast with fury fir'd<SPLIT>. For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears<SPLIT>; And lifted high the flaming sword appears<SPLIT>, Which<SPLIT>, full descending with a frightful sway<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' shield and corslet forc'd th<SPLIT>' impetuous way<SPLIT>, And buried deep in his fair bosom lay<SPLIT>. The purple streams thro<SPLIT>' the thin armor strove<SPLIT>, And drench'd th<SPLIT>' imbroider'd coat his mother wove<SPLIT>; And life at length forsook his heaving heart<SPLIT>, Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart<SPLIT>.
But when<SPLIT>, with blood and paleness all o<SPLIT>'erspread<SPLIT>, The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead<SPLIT>, He griev'd<SPLIT>; he wept<SPLIT>; the sight an image brought Of his own filial love<SPLIT>, a sadly pleasing thought<SPLIT>: Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up<SPLIT>, and said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Poor hapless youth<SPLIT>! what praises can be paid To love so great<SPLIT>, to such transcendent store Of early worth<SPLIT>, and sure presage of more<SPLIT>? Accept whate<SPLIT>'er Aeneas can afford<SPLIT>; Untouch'd thy arms<SPLIT>, untaken be thy sword<SPLIT>; And all that pleas'd thee living<SPLIT>, still remain Inviolate<SPLIT>, and sacred to the slain<SPLIT>. Thy body on thy parents I bestow<SPLIT>, To rest thy soul<SPLIT>, at least<SPLIT>, if shadows know<SPLIT>, Or have a sense of human things below<SPLIT>. There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell<SPLIT>: ''<SPLIT>T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>'" With this<SPLIT>, his distant friends he beckons near<SPLIT>, Provokes their duty<SPLIT>, and prevents their fear<SPLIT>: Himself assists to lift him from the ground<SPLIT>, With clotted locks<SPLIT>, and blood that well'd from out the wound<SPLIT>.
Meantime<SPLIT>, his father<SPLIT>, now no father<SPLIT>, stood<SPLIT>, And wash'd his wounds by Tiber<SPLIT>'s yellow flood<SPLIT>: Oppress'd with anguish<SPLIT>, panting<SPLIT>, and o<SPLIT>'erspent<SPLIT>, His fainting limbs against an oak he leant<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>bough his brazen helmet did sustain<SPLIT>; His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>chosen train of youth around him stand<SPLIT>; His drooping head was rested on his hand<SPLIT>: His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought<SPLIT>; And all on Lausus ran his restless thought<SPLIT>. Careful<SPLIT>, concern'd his danger to prevent<SPLIT>, He much enquir'd<SPLIT>, and many a message sent To warn him from the field<SPLIT>- alas<SPLIT>! in vain<SPLIT>! Behold<SPLIT>, his mournful followers bear him slain<SPLIT>! O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound<SPLIT>, And drew a bloody trail along the ground<SPLIT>. Far off he heard their cries<SPLIT>, far off divin'd The dire event<SPLIT>, with a foreboding mind<SPLIT>. With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head<SPLIT>; Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread<SPLIT>; Last<SPLIT>, the dear corpse embracing<SPLIT>, thus he said<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What joys<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! could this frail being give<SPLIT>, That I have been so covetous to live<SPLIT>? To see my son<SPLIT>, and such a son<SPLIT>, resign His life<SPLIT>, a ransom for preserving mine<SPLIT>! And am I then preserv'd<SPLIT>, and art thou lost<SPLIT>? How much too dear has that redemption cost<SPLIT>! '<SPLIT>T is now my bitter banishment I feel<SPLIT>: This is a wound too deep for time to heal<SPLIT>. My guilt thy growing virtues did defame<SPLIT>; My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name<SPLIT>. Chas'd from a throne<SPLIT>, abando<SPLIT>n'd<SPLIT>, and exil'd For foul misdeeds<SPLIT>, were punishments too mild<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>ow'd my people these<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, from their hate<SPLIT>, With less resentment could have borne my fate<SPLIT>. And yet I live<SPLIT>, and yet sustain the sight Of hated men<SPLIT>, and of more hated light<SPLIT>: But will not long<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" With that he rais'd from ground His fainting limbs<SPLIT>, that stagger'd with his wound<SPLIT>; Yet<SPLIT>, with a mind resolv'd<SPLIT>, and unappall'd With pains or perils<SPLIT>, for his courser call'd Well-mouth'd<SPLIT>, well-manag'd<SPLIT>, whom himself did dress With daily care<SPLIT>, and mounted with success<SPLIT>; His aid in arms<SPLIT>, his ornament in peace<SPLIT>.
Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke<SPLIT>, The steed seem'd sensible<SPLIT>, while thus he spoke<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O Rhoebus<SPLIT>, we have liv'd too long for me- If life and long were terms that could agree<SPLIT>! This day thou either shalt bring back the head And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead<SPLIT>; This day thou either shalt revenge my woe<SPLIT>, For murther'd Lausus<SPLIT>, on his cruel foe<SPLIT>; Or<SPLIT>, if inexorable fate deny Our conquest<SPLIT>, with thy conquer'd master die<SPLIT>: For<SPLIT>, after such a lord<SPLIT>, I rest secure<SPLIT>, Thou wilt no foreign reins<SPLIT>, or Trojan load endure<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and straight th<SPLIT>' officious courser kneels<SPLIT>, To take his wonted weight<SPLIT>. His hands he fills With pointed jav'lins<SPLIT>; on his head he lac'd His glitt<SPLIT>'ring helm<SPLIT>, which terribly was grac'd With waving horsehair<SPLIT>, nodding from afar<SPLIT>; Then spurr'd his thund<SPLIT>'ring steed amidst the war<SPLIT>. Love<SPLIT>, anguish<SPLIT>, wrath<SPLIT>, and grief<SPLIT>, to madness wrought<SPLIT>, Despair<SPLIT>, and secret shame<SPLIT>, and conscious thought Of inborn worth<SPLIT>, his lab'ring soul oppress'd<SPLIT>, Roll'd in his eyes<SPLIT>, and rag'd within his breast<SPLIT>. Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name<SPLIT>: The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Great Jove<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>and the far-shooting god<SPLIT>, Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" He spoke no more<SPLIT>; but hasten'd<SPLIT>, void of fear<SPLIT>, And threaten'd with his long protended spear<SPLIT>.
To whom Mezentius thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Thy vaunts are vain<SPLIT>. My Lausus lies extended on the plain<SPLIT>: He<SPLIT>'s lost<SPLIT>! thy conquest is already won<SPLIT>; The wretched sire is murther'd in the son<SPLIT>. Nor fate I fear<SPLIT>, but all the gods defy<SPLIT>. Forbear thy threats<SPLIT>: my bus'ness is to die<SPLIT>; But first receive this parting legacy<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and straight a whirling dart he sent<SPLIT>; Another after<SPLIT>, and another went<SPLIT>. Round in a spacious ring he rides the field<SPLIT>, And vainly plies th<SPLIT>' impenetrable shield<SPLIT>. Thrice rode he round<SPLIT>; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd<SPLIT>, Turn'd as he turn'd<SPLIT>: the golden orb withstood The strokes<SPLIT>, and bore about an iron wood<SPLIT>. Impatient of delay<SPLIT>, and weary grown<SPLIT>, Still to defend<SPLIT>, and to defend alone<SPLIT>, To wrench the darts which in his buckler light<SPLIT>, Urg'd and o<SPLIT>'er-labor'd in unequal fight<SPLIT>; At length resolv'd<SPLIT>, he throws with all his force Full at the temples of the warrior horse<SPLIT>. Just where the stroke was aim'd<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' unerring spear Made way<SPLIT>, and stood transfix'd thro<SPLIT>' either ear<SPLIT>. Seiz'd with unwonted pain<SPLIT>, surpris'd with fright<SPLIT>, The wounded steed curvets<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, rais'd upright<SPLIT>, Lights on his feet before<SPLIT>; his hoofs behind Spring up in air aloft<SPLIT>, and lash the wind<SPLIT>. Down comes the rider headlong from his height<SPLIT>: His horse came after with unwieldy weight<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, flound<SPLIT>'ring forward<SPLIT>, pitching on his head<SPLIT>, His lord<SPLIT>'s incumber'd shoulder overlaid<SPLIT>.
From either host<SPLIT>, the mingled shouts and cries Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies<SPLIT>. Aeneas<SPLIT>, has<SPLIT>t<SPLIT>'ning<SPLIT>, wav'd his fatal sword High o<SPLIT>'er his head<SPLIT>, with this reproachful word<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Now<SPLIT>; where are now thy vaunts<SPLIT>, the fierce disdain Of proud Mezentius<SPLIT>, and the lofty strain<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>"
Struggling<SPLIT>, and wildly staring on the skies<SPLIT>, With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Why these insulting words<SPLIT>, this waste of breath<SPLIT>, To souls undaunted<SPLIT>, and secure of death<SPLIT>? '<SPLIT>T is no dishonor for the brave to die<SPLIT>, Nor came I here with hope victory<SPLIT>; Nor ask I life<SPLIT>, nor fought with that design<SPLIT>: As I had us'd my fortune<SPLIT>, use thou thine<SPLIT>. My dying son contracted no such band<SPLIT>; The gift is hateful from his murd<SPLIT>'rer<SPLIT>'s hand<SPLIT>. For this<SPLIT>, this only favor let me sue<SPLIT>, If pity can to conquer'd foes be due<SPLIT>: Refuse it not<SPLIT>; but let my body have The last retreat of humankind<SPLIT>, a grave<SPLIT>. Too well I know th<SPLIT>' insulting people<SPLIT>'s hate<SPLIT>; Protect me from their vengeance after fate<SPLIT>: This refuge for my poor remains provide<SPLIT>, And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and to the sword his throat applied<SPLIT>. The crimson stream distain'd his arms around<SPLIT>, And the disdainful soul came rushing thro<SPLIT>' the wound<SPLIT>.

BOOK XI
Scarce had the rosy Morning rais'd her head Above the waves<SPLIT>, and left her wat<SPLIT>'ry bed<SPLIT>; The pious chief<SPLIT>, whom double cares attend For his unburied soldiers and his friend<SPLIT>, Yet first to Heav'n perform'd a victor<SPLIT>'s vows<SPLIT>: He bar'd an ancient oak of all her boughs<SPLIT>; Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac'd<SPLIT>, Which with the spoils of his dead foe he grac'd<SPLIT>. The coat of arms by proud Mezentius worn<SPLIT>, Now on a naked snag in triumph borne<SPLIT>, Was hung on high<SPLIT>, and glitter'd from afar<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>trophy sacred to the God of War<SPLIT>. Above his arms<SPLIT>, fix'd on the leafless wood<SPLIT>, Appear'd his plumy crest<SPLIT>, besmear'd with blood<SPLIT>: His brazen buckler on the left was seen<SPLIT>; Truncheons of shiver'd lances hung between<SPLIT>; And on the right was placed his corslet<SPLIT>, bor'd<SPLIT>; And to the neck was tied his unavailing sword<SPLIT>.
A<SPLIT>crowd of chiefs inclose the godlike man<SPLIT>, Who thus<SPLIT>, conspicuous in the midst<SPLIT>, began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Our toils<SPLIT>, my friends<SPLIT>, are crown'd with sure success<SPLIT>; The greater part perform'd<SPLIT>, achieve the less<SPLIT>. Now follow cheerful to the trembling town<SPLIT>; Press but an entrance<SPLIT>, and presume it won<SPLIT>. Fear is no more<SPLIT>, for fierce Mezentius lies<SPLIT>, As the first fruits of war<SPLIT>, a sacrifice<SPLIT>. Turnus shall fall extended on the plain<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, in this omen<SPLIT>, is already slain<SPLIT>. Prepar'd in arms<SPLIT>, pursue your happy chance<SPLIT>; That none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance<SPLIT>, And I<SPLIT>, at Heav'n<SPLIT>'s appointed hour<SPLIT>, may find Your warlike ensigns waving in the wind<SPLIT>. Meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare<SPLIT>, Due to your dead companions of the war<SPLIT>: The last respect the living can bestow<SPLIT>, To shield their shadows from contempt below<SPLIT>. That conquer'd earth be theirs<SPLIT>, for which they fought<SPLIT>, And which for us with their own blood they bought<SPLIT>; But first the corpse of our unhappy friend To the sad city of Evander send<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, not inglorious<SPLIT>, in his age<SPLIT>'s bloom<SPLIT>, Was hurried hence by too severe a doom<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus<SPLIT>, weeping while he spoke<SPLIT>, he took his way<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>, new in death<SPLIT>, lamented Pallas lay<SPLIT>. Acoetes watch'd the corpse<SPLIT>; whose youth deserv'd The father<SPLIT>'s trust<SPLIT>; and now the son he serv'd With equal faith<SPLIT>, but less auspicious care<SPLIT>. Th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>troop of Trojans mix'd with these appear<SPLIT>, And mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair<SPLIT>. Soon as the prince appears<SPLIT>, they raise a cry<SPLIT>; All beat their breasts<SPLIT>, and echoes rend the sky<SPLIT>. They rear his drooping forehead from the ground<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, when Aeneas view'd the grisly wound Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore<SPLIT>, And the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore<SPLIT>; First<SPLIT>, melting into tears<SPLIT>, the pious man Deplor'd so sad a sight<SPLIT>, then thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Unhappy youth<SPLIT>! when Fortune gave the rest Of my full wishes<SPLIT>, she refus'd the best<SPLIT>! She came<SPLIT>; but brought not thee along<SPLIT>, to bless My longing eyes<SPLIT>, and share in my success<SPLIT>: She grudg'd thy safe return<SPLIT>, the triumphs due To prosp'rous valor<SPLIT>, in the public view<SPLIT>. Not thus I promis'd<SPLIT>, when thy father lent Thy needless succor with a sad consent<SPLIT>; Embrac'd me<SPLIT>, parting for th<SPLIT>' Etrurian land<SPLIT>, And sent me to possess a large command<SPLIT>. He war<SPLIT>n'd<SPLIT>, and from his own experience told<SPLIT>, Our foes were warlike<SPLIT>, disciplin'd<SPLIT>, and bold<SPLIT>. And now perhaps<SPLIT>, in hopes of thy return<SPLIT>, Rich odors on his loaded altars burn<SPLIT>, While we<SPLIT>, with vain officious pomp<SPLIT>, prepare To send him back his portion of the war<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>bloody breathless body<SPLIT>, which can owe No farther debt<SPLIT>, but to the pow'rs below<SPLIT>. The wretched father<SPLIT>, ere his race is run<SPLIT>, Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son<SPLIT>. These are my triumphs of the Latian war<SPLIT>, Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care<SPLIT>! And yet<SPLIT>, unhappy sire<SPLIT>, thou shalt not see A<SPLIT>son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry<SPLIT>; Thou shalt not blush<SPLIT>, old man<SPLIT>, however griev'd<SPLIT>: Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd<SPLIT>. He died no death to make thee wish<SPLIT>, too late<SPLIT>, Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate<SPLIT>: But what a champion has th<SPLIT>' Ausonian coast<SPLIT>, And what a friend hast thou<SPLIT>, Ascanius<SPLIT>, lost<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
Thus having mourn'd<SPLIT>, he gave the word around<SPLIT>, To raise the breathless body from the ground<SPLIT>; And chose a thousand horse<SPLIT>, the flow<SPLIT>'r of all His warlike troops<SPLIT>, to wait the funeral<SPLIT>, To bear him back and share Evander<SPLIT>'s grief<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>well-becoming<SPLIT>, but a weak relief<SPLIT>. Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier<SPLIT>, Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear<SPLIT>. The body on this rural hearse is borne<SPLIT>: Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn<SPLIT>. All pale he lies<SPLIT>, and looks a lovely flow<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>, New cropp'd by virgin hands<SPLIT>, to dress the bow<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>: Unfaded yet<SPLIT>, but yet unfed below<SPLIT>, No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe<SPLIT>. Then two fair vests<SPLIT>, of wondrous work and cost<SPLIT>, Of purple woven<SPLIT>, and with gold emboss'd<SPLIT>, For ornament the Trojan hero brought<SPLIT>, Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought<SPLIT>. One vest array'd the corpse<SPLIT>; and one they spread O'er his clos'd eyes<SPLIT>, and wrapp'd around his head<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, when the yellow hair in flame should fall<SPLIT>, The catching fire might burn the golden caul<SPLIT>. Besides<SPLIT>, the spoils of foes in battle slain<SPLIT>, When he descended on the Latian plain<SPLIT>; Arms<SPLIT>, trappings<SPLIT>, horses<SPLIT>, by the hearse are led In long array- th<SPLIT>' achievements of the dead<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, pinion'd with their hands behind<SPLIT>, appear Th' unhappy captives<SPLIT>, marching in the rear<SPLIT>, Appointed off'rings in the victor<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>, To sprinkle with their blood the fun'ral flame<SPLIT>. Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne<SPLIT>; Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn<SPLIT>; And fair inscriptions fix'd<SPLIT>, and titles read Of Latian leaders conquer'd by the dead<SPLIT>.
Acoetes on his pupil<SPLIT>'s corpse attends<SPLIT>, With feeble steps<SPLIT>, supported by his friends<SPLIT>. Pausing at ev'ry pace<SPLIT>, in sorrow drown'd<SPLIT>, Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground<SPLIT>; Where grov'ling while he lies in deep despair<SPLIT>, He beats his breast<SPLIT>, and rends his hoary hair<SPLIT>. The champion<SPLIT>'s chariot next is seen to roll<SPLIT>, Besmear'd with hostile blood<SPLIT>, and honorably foul<SPLIT>. To close the pomp<SPLIT>, Aethon<SPLIT>, the steed of state<SPLIT>, Is led<SPLIT>, the fun'rals of his lord to wait<SPLIT>. Stripp'd of his trappings<SPLIT>, with a sullen pace He walks<SPLIT>; and the big tears run rolling down his face<SPLIT>. The lance of Pallas<SPLIT>, and the crimson crest<SPLIT>, Are borne behind<SPLIT>: the victor seiz'd the rest<SPLIT>. The march begins<SPLIT>: the trumpets hoarsely sound<SPLIT>; The pikes and lances trail along the ground<SPLIT>. Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course<SPLIT>, In long procession rank'd<SPLIT>, the pious chief Stopp'd in the rear<SPLIT>, and gave a vent to grief<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The public care<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" he said<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>which war attends<SPLIT>, Diverts our present woes<SPLIT>, at least suspends<SPLIT>. Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell<SPLIT>! Hail<SPLIT>, holy relics<SPLIT>! and a last farewell<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" He said no more<SPLIT>, but<SPLIT>, inly thro<SPLIT>' he mourn'd<SPLIT>, Restrained his tears<SPLIT>, and to the camp return'd<SPLIT>.
Now suppliants<SPLIT>, from Laurentum sent<SPLIT>, demand A<SPLIT>truce<SPLIT>, with olive branches in their hand<SPLIT>; Obtest his clemency<SPLIT>, and from the plain Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain<SPLIT>. They plead<SPLIT>, that none those common rites deny To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die<SPLIT>. All cause of hate was ended in their death<SPLIT>; Nor could he war with bodies void of breath<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>king<SPLIT>, they hop'd<SPLIT>, would hear a king<SPLIT>'s request<SPLIT>, Whose son he once was call'd<SPLIT>, and once his guest<SPLIT>.
Their suit<SPLIT>, which was too just to be denied<SPLIT>, The hero grants<SPLIT>, and farther thus replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O Latian princes<SPLIT>, how severe a fate In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state<SPLIT>, And arm'd against an unoffending man<SPLIT>, Who sought your friendship ere the war began<SPLIT>! You beg a truce<SPLIT>, which I would gladly give<SPLIT>, Not only for the slain<SPLIT>, but those who live<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>came not hither but by Heav'n<SPLIT>'s command<SPLIT>, And sent by fate to share the Latian land<SPLIT>. Nor wage I wars unjust<SPLIT>: your king denied My proffer'd friendship<SPLIT>, and my promis'd bride<SPLIT>; Left me for Turnus<SPLIT>. Turnus then should try His cause in arms<SPLIT>, to conquer or to die<SPLIT>. My right and his are in dispute<SPLIT>: the slain Fell without fault<SPLIT>, our quarrel to maintain<SPLIT>. In equal arms let us alone contend<SPLIT>; And let him vanquish<SPLIT>, whom his fates befriend<SPLIT>. This is the way (<SPLIT>so tell him<SPLIT>) to possess The royal virgin<SPLIT>, and restore the peace<SPLIT>. Bear this message back<SPLIT>, with ample leave<SPLIT>, That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus having said<SPLIT>- th<SPLIT>' embassadors<SPLIT>, amaz'd<SPLIT>, Stood mute a while<SPLIT>, and on each other gaz'd<SPLIT>. Drances<SPLIT>, their chief<SPLIT>, who harbor'd in his breast Long hate to Turnus<SPLIT>, as his foe profess'd<SPLIT>, Broke silence first<SPLIT>, and to the godlike man<SPLIT>, With graceful action bowing<SPLIT>, thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Auspicious prince<SPLIT>, in arms a mighty name<SPLIT>, But yet whose actions far transcend your fame<SPLIT>; Would I your justice or your force express<SPLIT>, Thought can but equal<SPLIT>; and all words are less<SPLIT>. Your answer we shall thankfully relate<SPLIT>, And favors granted to the Latian state<SPLIT>. If wish'd success our labor shall attend<SPLIT>, Think peace concluded<SPLIT>, and the king your friend<SPLIT>: Let Turnus leave the realm to your command<SPLIT>, And seek alliance in some other land<SPLIT>: Build you the city which your fates assign<SPLIT>; We shall be proud in the great work to join<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus Drances<SPLIT>; and his words so well persuade The rest impower'd<SPLIT>, that soon a truce is made<SPLIT>. Twelve days the term allow'd<SPLIT>: and<SPLIT>, during those<SPLIT>, Latians and Trojans<SPLIT>, now no longer foes<SPLIT>, Mix'd in the woods<SPLIT>, for fun'ral piles prepare To fell the timber<SPLIT>, and forget the war<SPLIT>. Loud axes thro<SPLIT>' the groaning groves resound<SPLIT>; Oak<SPLIT>, mountain ash<SPLIT>, and poplar spread the ground<SPLIT>; First fall from high<SPLIT>; and some the trunks receive In loaden wains<SPLIT>; with wedges some they cleave<SPLIT>.
And now the fatal news by Fame is blown Thro<SPLIT>' the short circuit of th<SPLIT>' Arcadian town<SPLIT>, Of Pallas slain- by Fame<SPLIT>, which just before His triumphs on distended pinions bore<SPLIT>. Rushing from out the gate<SPLIT>, the people stand<SPLIT>, Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand<SPLIT>. Wildly they stare<SPLIT>, distracted with amaze<SPLIT>: The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze<SPLIT>, That cast a sullen splendor on their friends<SPLIT>, The marching troop which their dead prince attends<SPLIT>. Both parties meet<SPLIT>: they raise a doleful cry<SPLIT>; The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply<SPLIT>, And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky<SPLIT>. The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears<SPLIT>, Till the loud clamors reach Evander<SPLIT>'s ears<SPLIT>: Forgetful of his state<SPLIT>, he runs along<SPLIT>, With a disorder'd pace<SPLIT>, and cleaves the throng<SPLIT>; Falls on the corpse<SPLIT>; and groaning there he lies<SPLIT>, With silent grief<SPLIT>, that speaks but at his eyes<SPLIT>. Short sighs and sobs succeed<SPLIT>; till sorrow breaks A<SPLIT>passage<SPLIT>, and at once he weeps and speaks<SPLIT>:
"<SPLIT>O Pallas<SPLIT>! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word<SPLIT>, To fight with caution<SPLIT>, not to tempt the sword<SPLIT>! I<SPLIT>war<SPLIT>n'd thee<SPLIT>, but in vain<SPLIT>; for well I knew What perils youthful ardor would pursue<SPLIT>, That boiling blood would carry thee too far<SPLIT>, Young as thou wert in dangers<SPLIT>, raw to war<SPLIT>! O<SPLIT>curst essay of arms<SPLIT>, disastrous doom<SPLIT>, Prelude of bloody fields<SPLIT>, and fights to come<SPLIT>! Hard elements of unauspicious war<SPLIT>, Vain vows to Heav'n<SPLIT>, and unavailing care<SPLIT>! Thrice happy thou<SPLIT>, dear partner of my bed<SPLIT>, Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled<SPLIT>, Praescious of ills<SPLIT>, and leaving me behind<SPLIT>, To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd<SPLIT>! Beyond the goal of nature I have gone<SPLIT>: My Pallas late set out<SPLIT>, but reach'd too soon<SPLIT>. If<SPLIT>, for my league against th<SPLIT>' Ausonian state<SPLIT>, Amidst their weapons I had found my fate<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Deserv'd from them<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) then I had been return'd A<SPLIT>breathless victor<SPLIT>, and my son had mourn'd<SPLIT>. Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid<SPLIT>, Nor grudge th<SPLIT>' alliance I so gladly made<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T was not his fault<SPLIT>, my Pallas fell so young<SPLIT>, But my own crime<SPLIT>, for having liv'd too long<SPLIT>. Yet<SPLIT>, since the gods had destin'd him to die<SPLIT>, At least he led the way to victory<SPLIT>: First for his friends he won the fatal shore<SPLIT>, And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>death too great<SPLIT>, too glorious to deplore<SPLIT>. Nor will I add new honors to thy grave<SPLIT>, Content with those the Trojan hero gave<SPLIT>: That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd<SPLIT>, In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd<SPLIT>. Great spoils and trophies<SPLIT>, gain'd by thee<SPLIT>, they bear<SPLIT>: Then let thy own achievements be thy share<SPLIT>. Even thou<SPLIT>, O Turnus<SPLIT>, hadst a trophy stood<SPLIT>, Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood<SPLIT>, If Pallas had arriv'd<SPLIT>, with equal length Of years<SPLIT>, to match thy bulk with equal strength<SPLIT>. But why<SPLIT>, unhappy man<SPLIT>, dost thou detain These troops<SPLIT>, to view the tears thou shedd<SPLIT>'st in vain<SPLIT>? Go<SPLIT>, friends<SPLIT>, this message to your lord relate<SPLIT>: Tell him<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, if I bear my bitter fate<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, after Pallas<SPLIT>' death<SPLIT>, live ling<SPLIT>'ring on<SPLIT>, '<SPLIT>T is to behold his vengeance for my son<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>stay for Turnus<SPLIT>, whose devoted head Is owing to the living and the dead<SPLIT>. My son and I expect it from his hand<SPLIT>; '<SPLIT>T is all that he can give<SPLIT>, or we demand<SPLIT>. Joy is no more<SPLIT>; but I would gladly go<SPLIT>, To greet my Pallas with such news below<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night<SPLIT>, Restoring toils<SPLIT>, when she restor'd the light<SPLIT>. The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command To raise the piles along the winding strand<SPLIT>. Their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires<SPLIT>; Black smold<SPLIT>'ring smoke from the green wood expires<SPLIT>; The light of heav'n is chok'd<SPLIT>, and the new day retires<SPLIT>. Then thrice around the kindled piles they go (<SPLIT>For ancient custom had ordain'd it so<SPLIT>) Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led<SPLIT>; And thrice<SPLIT>, with loud laments<SPLIT>, they hail the dead<SPLIT>. Tears<SPLIT>, trickling down their breasts<SPLIT>, bedew the ground<SPLIT>, And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound<SPLIT>. Amid the blaze<SPLIT>, their pious brethren throw The spoils<SPLIT>, in battle taken from the foe<SPLIT>: Helms<SPLIT>, bits emboss'd<SPLIT>, and swords of shining steel<SPLIT>; One casts a target<SPLIT>, one a chariot wheel<SPLIT>; Some to their fellows their own arms restore<SPLIT>: The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore<SPLIT>, Their bucklers pierc'd<SPLIT>, their darts bestow'd in vain<SPLIT>, And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain<SPLIT>. Whole herds of offer'd bulls<SPLIT>, about the fire<SPLIT>, And bristled boars<SPLIT>, and woolly sheep expire<SPLIT>. Around the piles a careful troop attends<SPLIT>, To watch the wasting flames<SPLIT>, and weep their burning friends<SPLIT>; Ling<SPLIT>'ring along the shore<SPLIT>, till dewy night New decks the face of heav'n with starry light<SPLIT>.
The conquer'd Latians<SPLIT>, with like pious care<SPLIT>, Piles without number for their dead prepare<SPLIT>. Part in the places where they fell are laid<SPLIT>; And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd<SPLIT>. The corps of kings<SPLIT>, and captains of renown<SPLIT>, Borne off in state<SPLIT>, are buried in the town<SPLIT>; The rest<SPLIT>, unhonor'd<SPLIT>, and without a name<SPLIT>, Are cast a common heap to feed the flame<SPLIT>. Trojans and Latians vie with like desires To make the field of battle shine with fires<SPLIT>, And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires<SPLIT>.
Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light<SPLIT>, And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night<SPLIT>, When those who round the wasted fires remain<SPLIT>, Perform the last sad office to the slain<SPLIT>. They rake the yet warm ashes from below<SPLIT>; These<SPLIT>, and the bones unburn'd<SPLIT>, in earth bestow<SPLIT>; These relics with their country rites they grace<SPLIT>, And raise a mount of turf to mark the place<SPLIT>.
But<SPLIT>, in the palace of the king<SPLIT>, appears A<SPLIT>scene more solemn<SPLIT>, and a pomp of tears<SPLIT>. Maids<SPLIT>, matrons<SPLIT>, widows<SPLIT>, mix their common moans<SPLIT>; Orphans their sires<SPLIT>, and sires lament their sons<SPLIT>. All in that universal sorrow share<SPLIT>, And curse the cause of this unhappy war<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>broken league<SPLIT>, a bride unjustly sought<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>crown usurp'd<SPLIT>, which with their blood is bought<SPLIT>! These are the crimes with which they load the name Of Turnus<SPLIT>, and on him alone exclaim<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Let him who lords it o<SPLIT>'er th<SPLIT>' Ausonian land Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand<SPLIT>: His is the gain<SPLIT>; our lot is but to serve<SPLIT>; '<SPLIT>T is just<SPLIT>, the sway he seeks<SPLIT>, he should deserve<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This Drances aggravates<SPLIT>; and adds<SPLIT>, with spite<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>His foe expects<SPLIT>, and dares him to the fight<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Nor Turnus wants a party<SPLIT>, to support His cause and credit in the Latian court<SPLIT>. His former acts secure his present fame<SPLIT>, And the queen shades him with her mighty name<SPLIT>.
While thus their factious minds with fury burn<SPLIT>, The legates from th<SPLIT>' Aetolian prince return<SPLIT>: Sad news they bring<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, after all the cost And care employ'd<SPLIT>, their embassy is lost<SPLIT>; That Diomedes refus'd his aid in war<SPLIT>, Unmov'd with presents<SPLIT>, and as deaf to pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>. Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought<SPLIT>, Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought<SPLIT>.
Latinus<SPLIT>, sunk in sorrow<SPLIT>, finds too late<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>foreign son is pointed out by fate<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed<SPLIT>, The wrath of Heav'n is hov'ring o<SPLIT>'er his head<SPLIT>. The gods<SPLIT>, he saw<SPLIT>, espous'd the juster side<SPLIT>, When late their titles in the field were tried<SPLIT>: Witness the fresh laments<SPLIT>, and fun'ral tears undried<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, full of anxious thought<SPLIT>, he summons all The Latian senate to the council hall<SPLIT>. The princes come<SPLIT>, commanded by their head<SPLIT>, And crowd the paths that to the palace lead<SPLIT>. Supreme in pow'r<SPLIT>, and reverenc'd for his years<SPLIT>, He takes the throne<SPLIT>, and in the midst appears<SPLIT>. Majestically sad<SPLIT>, he sits in state<SPLIT>, And bids his envoys their success relate<SPLIT>.
When Venulus began<SPLIT>, the murmuring sound Was hush'd<SPLIT>, and sacred silence reign'd around<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>We have<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "perform'd your high command<SPLIT>, And pass'd with peril a long tract of land<SPLIT>: We reach'd the place desir'd<SPLIT>; with wonder fill'd<SPLIT>, The Grecian tents and rising tow'rs beheld<SPLIT>. Great Diomede has compass'd round with walls The city<SPLIT>, which Argyripa he calls<SPLIT>, From his own Argos nam'd<SPLIT>. We touch'd<SPLIT>, with joy<SPLIT>, The royal hand that raz'd unhappy Troy<SPLIT>. When introduc'd<SPLIT>, our presents first we bring<SPLIT>, Then crave an instant audience from the king<SPLIT>. His leave obtain'd<SPLIT>, our native soil we name<SPLIT>, And tell th<SPLIT>' important cause for which we came<SPLIT>. Attentively he heard us<SPLIT>, while we spoke<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, with soft accents<SPLIT>, and a pleasing look<SPLIT>, Made this return<SPLIT>: '<SPLIT>Ausonian race<SPLIT>, of old Renown'd for peace<SPLIT>, and for an age of gold<SPLIT>, What madness has your alter'd minds possess'd<SPLIT>, To change for war hereditary rest<SPLIT>, Solicit arms unknown<SPLIT>, and tempt the sword<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>needless ill your ancestors abhorr'd<SPLIT>? We- for myself I speak<SPLIT>, and all the name Of Grecians<SPLIT>, who to Troy<SPLIT>'s destruction came<SPLIT>, Omitting those who were in battle slain<SPLIT>, Or borne by rolling Simois to the main- Not one but suffer'd<SPLIT>, and too dearly bought The prize of honor which in arms he sought<SPLIT>; Some doom'd to death<SPLIT>, and some in exile driv'n<SPLIT>. Outcasts<SPLIT>, abando<SPLIT>n'd by the care of Heav'n<SPLIT>; So worn<SPLIT>, so wretched<SPLIT>, so despis'd a crew<SPLIT>, As ev'n old Priam might with pity view<SPLIT>. Witness the vessels by Minerva toss'd In storms<SPLIT>; the vengeful Capharean coast<SPLIT>; Th' Euboean rocks<SPLIT>! the prince<SPLIT>, whose brother led Our armies to revenge his injur'd bed<SPLIT>, In Egypt lost<SPLIT>! Ulysses with his men Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops<SPLIT>' den<SPLIT>. Why should I name Idomeneus<SPLIT>, in vain Restor'd to scepters<SPLIT>, and expell'd again<SPLIT>? Or young Achilles<SPLIT>, by his rival slain<SPLIT>? Ev'n he<SPLIT>, the King of Men<SPLIT>, the foremost name Of all the Greeks<SPLIT>, and most renown'd by fame<SPLIT>, The proud revenger of another<SPLIT>'s wife<SPLIT>, Yet by his own adult<SPLIT>'ress lost his life<SPLIT>; Fell at his threshold<SPLIT>; and the spoils of Troy The foul polluters of his bed enjoy<SPLIT>. The gods have envied me the sweets of life<SPLIT>, My much lov'd country<SPLIT>, and my more lov'd wife<SPLIT>: Banish'd from both<SPLIT>, I mourn<SPLIT>; while in the sky<SPLIT>, Transform'd to birds<SPLIT>, my lost companions fly<SPLIT>: Hov'ring about the coasts<SPLIT>, they make their moan<SPLIT>, And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own<SPLIT>. What squalid specters<SPLIT>, in the dead of night<SPLIT>, Break my short sleep<SPLIT>, and skim before my sight<SPLIT>! I<SPLIT>might have promis'd to myself those harms<SPLIT>, Mad as I was<SPLIT>, when I<SPLIT>, with mortal arms<SPLIT>, Presum'd against immortal pow'rs to move<SPLIT>, And violate with wounds the Queen of Love<SPLIT>. Such arms this hand shall never more employ<SPLIT>; No hate remains with me to ruin'd Troy<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>war not with its dust<SPLIT>; nor am I glad To think of past events<SPLIT>, or good or bad<SPLIT>. Your presents I return<SPLIT>: whate<SPLIT>'er you bring To buy my friendship<SPLIT>, send the Trojan king<SPLIT>. We met in fight<SPLIT>; I know him<SPLIT>, to my cost<SPLIT>: With what a whirling force his lance he toss'd<SPLIT>! Heav'ns<SPLIT>! what a spring was in his arm<SPLIT>, to throw<SPLIT>! How high he held his shield<SPLIT>, and rose at ev'ry blow<SPLIT>! Had Troy produc'd two more his match in might<SPLIT>, They would have chang'd the fortune of the fight<SPLIT>: Th' invasion of the Greeks had been return'd<SPLIT>, Our empire wasted<SPLIT>, and our cities burn'd<SPLIT>. The long defense the Trojan people made<SPLIT>, The war protracted<SPLIT>, and the siege delay'd<SPLIT>, Were due to Hector<SPLIT>'s and this hero<SPLIT>'s hand<SPLIT>: Both brave alike<SPLIT>, and equal in command<SPLIT>; Aeneas<SPLIT>, not inferior in the field<SPLIT>, In pious reverence to the gods excell'd<SPLIT>. Make peace<SPLIT>, ye Latians<SPLIT>, and avoid with care Th' impending dangers of a fatal war<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' He said no more<SPLIT>; but<SPLIT>, with this cold excuse<SPLIT>, Refus'd th<SPLIT>' alliance<SPLIT>, and advis'd a truce<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus Venulus concluded his report<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>jarring murmur fill'd the factious court<SPLIT>: As<SPLIT>, when a torrent rolls with rapid force<SPLIT>, And dashes o<SPLIT>'er the stones that stop the course<SPLIT>, The flood<SPLIT>, constrain'd within a scanty space<SPLIT>, Roars horrible along th<SPLIT>' uneasy race<SPLIT>; White foam in gath'ring eddies floats around<SPLIT>; The rocky shores rebellow to the sound<SPLIT>.
The murmur ceas'd<SPLIT>: then from his lofty throne The king invok'd the gods<SPLIT>, and thus begun<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>I wish<SPLIT>, ye Latins<SPLIT>, what we now debate Had been resolv'd before it was too late<SPLIT>. Much better had it been for you and me<SPLIT>, Unforc'd by this our last necessity<SPLIT>, To have been earlier wise<SPLIT>, than now to call A<SPLIT>council<SPLIT>, when the foe surrounds the wall<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>citizens<SPLIT>, we wage unequal war<SPLIT>, With men not only Heav'n<SPLIT>'s peculiar care<SPLIT>, But Heav'n<SPLIT>'s own race<SPLIT>; unconquer'd in the field<SPLIT>, Or<SPLIT>, conquer'd<SPLIT>, yet unknowing how to yield<SPLIT>. What hopes you had in Diomedes<SPLIT>, lay down<SPLIT>: Our hopes must center on ourselves alone<SPLIT>. Yet those how feeble<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, indeed<SPLIT>, how vain<SPLIT>, You see too well<SPLIT>; nor need my words explain<SPLIT>. Vanquish'd without resource<SPLIT>; laid flat by fate<SPLIT>; Factions within<SPLIT>, a foe without the gate<SPLIT>! Not but I grant that all perform'd their parts With manly force<SPLIT>, and with undaunted hearts<SPLIT>: With our united strength the war we wag'd<SPLIT>; With equal numbers<SPLIT>, equal arms<SPLIT>, engag'd<SPLIT>. You see th<SPLIT>' event.<SPLIT>- Now hear what I propose<SPLIT>, To save our friends<SPLIT>, and satisfy our foes<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>tract of land the Latins have possess'd Along the Tiber<SPLIT>, stretching to the west<SPLIT>, Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till<SPLIT>, And their mix'd cattle graze the fruitful hill<SPLIT>. Those mountains fill'd with firs<SPLIT>, that lower land<SPLIT>, If you consent<SPLIT>, the Trojan shall command<SPLIT>, Call'd into part of what is ours<SPLIT>; and there<SPLIT>, On terms agreed<SPLIT>, the common country share<SPLIT>. There let<SPLIT>'em build and settle<SPLIT>, if they please<SPLIT>; Unless they choose once more to cross the seas<SPLIT>, In search of seats remote from Italy<SPLIT>, And from unwelcome inmates set us free<SPLIT>. Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed<SPLIT>, Or twice as many more<SPLIT>, if more they need<SPLIT>. Materials are at hand<SPLIT>; a well-grown wood Runs equal with the margin of the flood<SPLIT>: Let them the number and the form assign<SPLIT>; The care and cost of all the stores be mine<SPLIT>. To treat the peace<SPLIT>, a hundred senators Shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs<SPLIT>, With olive the presents they shall bear<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>purple robe<SPLIT>, a royal iv'ry chair<SPLIT>, And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear<SPLIT>, And sums of gold<SPLIT>. Among yourselves debate This great affair<SPLIT>, and save the sinking state<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Then Drances took the word<SPLIT>, who grudg'd<SPLIT>, long since<SPLIT>, The rising glories of the Daunian prince<SPLIT>. Factious and rich<SPLIT>, bold at the council board<SPLIT>, But cautious in the field<SPLIT>, he shunn'd the sword<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>close caballer<SPLIT>, and tongue-valiant lord<SPLIT>. Noble his mother was<SPLIT>, and near the throne<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, what his father<SPLIT>'s parentage<SPLIT>, unknown<SPLIT>. He rose<SPLIT>, and took th<SPLIT>' advantage of the times<SPLIT>, To load young Turnus with invidious crimes<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Such truths<SPLIT>, O king<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "your words contain<SPLIT>, As strike the sense<SPLIT>, and all replies are vain<SPLIT>; Nor are your loyal subjects now to seek What common needs require<SPLIT>, but fear to speak<SPLIT>. Let him give leave of speech<SPLIT>, that haughty man<SPLIT>, Whose pride this unauspicious war began<SPLIT>; For whose ambition (<SPLIT>let me dare to say<SPLIT>, Fear set apart<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' death is in my way<SPLIT>) The plains of Latium run with blood around<SPLIT>. So many valiant heroes bite the ground<SPLIT>; Dejected grief in ev'ry face appears<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>town in mourning<SPLIT>, and a land in tears<SPLIT>; While he<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' undoubted author of our harms<SPLIT>, The man who menaces the gods with arms<SPLIT>, Yet<SPLIT>, after all his boasts<SPLIT>, forsook the fight<SPLIT>, And sought his safety in ignoble flight<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, best of kings<SPLIT>, since you propose to send Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend<SPLIT>; Add yet a greater at our joint request<SPLIT>, One which he values more than all the rest<SPLIT>: Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride<SPLIT>; With that alliance let the league be tied<SPLIT>, And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide<SPLIT>. Let insolence no longer awe the throne<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, with a father<SPLIT>'s right<SPLIT>, bestow your own<SPLIT>. For this maligner of the general good<SPLIT>, If still we fear his force<SPLIT>, he must be woo'd<SPLIT>; His haughty godhead we with pray<SPLIT>'rs implore<SPLIT>, Your scepter to release<SPLIT>, and our just rights restore<SPLIT>. O<SPLIT>cursed cause of all our ills<SPLIT>, must we Wage wars unjust<SPLIT>, and fall in fight<SPLIT>, for thee<SPLIT>! What right hast thou to rule the Latian state<SPLIT>, And send us out to meet our certain fate<SPLIT>? '<SPLIT>T is a destructive war<SPLIT>: from Turnus<SPLIT>' hand Our peace and public safety we demand<SPLIT>. Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain<SPLIT>; If not<SPLIT>, the peace<SPLIT>, without the pledge<SPLIT>, is vain<SPLIT>.

Pity your own<SPLIT>, or pity our estate<SPLIT>; Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate<SPLIT>. Your interest is<SPLIT>, the war should never cease<SPLIT>; But we have felt enough to wish the peace<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>land exhausted to the last remains<SPLIT>, Depopulated towns<SPLIT>, and driven plains<SPLIT>.

Mankind<SPLIT>, it seems<SPLIT>, is made for you alone<SPLIT>; We<SPLIT>, but the slaves who mount you to the throne<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>base ignoble crowd<SPLIT>, without a name<SPLIT>, Unwept<SPLIT>, unworthy<SPLIT>, of the fun'ral flame<SPLIT>, By duty bound to forfeit each his life<SPLIT>, That Turnus may possess a royal wife<SPLIT>.

Rather alone your matchless force employ<SPLIT>, To merit what alone you must enjoy<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
These words<SPLIT>, so full of malice mix'd with art<SPLIT>, Inflam'd with rage the youthful hero<SPLIT>'s heart<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, groaning from the bottom of his breast<SPLIT>, He heav'd for wind<SPLIT>, and thus his wrath express'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>You<SPLIT>, Drances<SPLIT>, never want a stream of words<SPLIT>, Then<SPLIT>, when the public need requires our swords<SPLIT>.

'<SPLIT>T is a destructive war<SPLIT>? So let it be<SPLIT>, But to the Phrygian pirate<SPLIT>, and to thee<SPLIT>!

Believe thy fables<SPLIT>, and the Trojan town Triumphant stands<SPLIT>; the Grecians are o<SPLIT>'erthrown<SPLIT>; Suppliant at Hector<SPLIT>'s feet Achilles lies<SPLIT>, And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies<SPLIT>.

"<SPLIT>Now<SPLIT>, royal father<SPLIT>, to the present state Of our affairs<SPLIT>, and of this high debate<SPLIT>: If in your arms thus early you diffide<SPLIT>, And think your fortune is already tried<SPLIT>; If one defeat has brought us down so low<SPLIT>, As never more in fields to meet the foe<SPLIT>; Then I conclude for peace<SPLIT>: 't is time to treat<SPLIT>, And lie like vassals at the victor<SPLIT>'s feet<SPLIT>.

While they debate<SPLIT>, nor these nor those will yield<SPLIT>, Aeneas draws his forces to the field<SPLIT>, And moves his camp<SPLIT>. The scouts with flying speed Return<SPLIT>, and thro<SPLIT>' the frighted city spread Th' unpleasing news<SPLIT>, the Trojans are descried<SPLIT>, In battle marching by the river side<SPLIT>, And bending to the town<SPLIT>. They take th<SPLIT>' alarm<SPLIT>: Some tremble<SPLIT>, some are bold<SPLIT>; all in confusion arm<SPLIT>.

Turnus th<SPLIT>' occasion takes<SPLIT>, and cries aloud<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Talk on<SPLIT>, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd<SPLIT>: Declaim in praise of peace<SPLIT>, when danger calls<SPLIT>, And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, turning short<SPLIT>, with speedy pace<SPLIT>, Casts back a scornful glance<SPLIT>, and quits the place<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Thou<SPLIT>, Volusus<SPLIT>, the Volscian troops command To mount<SPLIT>; and lead thyself our Ardean band<SPLIT>.

Some guard the passes<SPLIT>, others man the wall<SPLIT>; Drawn up in arms<SPLIT>, the rest attend my call<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town<SPLIT>, And with disorder'd haste the rampires crown<SPLIT>. Good old Latinus<SPLIT>, when he saw<SPLIT>, too late<SPLIT>, The gath'ring storm just breaking on the state<SPLIT>, Dismiss'd the council till a fitter time<SPLIT>, And own'd his easy temper as his crime<SPLIT>, Who<SPLIT>, forc'd against his reason<SPLIT>, had complied To break the treaty for the promis'd bride<SPLIT>.
Some help to sink new trenches<SPLIT>; others aid To ram the stones<SPLIT>, or raise the palisade<SPLIT>. Hoarse trumpets sound th<SPLIT>' alarm<SPLIT>; around the walls Runs a distracted crew<SPLIT>, whom their last labor calls<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>sad procession in the streets is seen<SPLIT>, Of matrons<SPLIT>, that attend the mother queen<SPLIT>: High in her chair she sits<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, at her side<SPLIT>, With downcast eyes<SPLIT>, appears the fatal bride<SPLIT>.

Now Turnus arms for fight<SPLIT>. His back and breast Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest<SPLIT>: The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold Are mingled metal damask'd o<SPLIT>'er with gold<SPLIT>. His faithful fauchion sits upon his side<SPLIT>; Nor casque<SPLIT>, nor crest<SPLIT>, his manly features hide<SPLIT>: But<SPLIT>, bare to view<SPLIT>, amid surrounding friends<SPLIT>, With godlike grace<SPLIT>, he from the tow'r descends<SPLIT>. Exulting in his strength<SPLIT>, he seems to dare His absent rival<SPLIT>, and to promise war<SPLIT>.

Turnus a while stood mute<SPLIT>, with glad surprise<SPLIT>, And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes<SPLIT>; Then thus return'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O grace of Italy<SPLIT>, With what becoming thanks can I reply<SPLIT>? Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast<SPLIT>, But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd<SPLIT>. Yet rob me not of all<SPLIT>; but let me join My toils<SPLIT>, my hazard<SPLIT>, and my fame<SPLIT>, with thine<SPLIT>. The Trojan<SPLIT>, not in stratagem unskill'd<SPLIT>, Sends his light horse before to scour the field<SPLIT>: Himself<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' steep ascents and thorny brakes<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>larger compass to the city takes<SPLIT>. This news my scouts confirm<SPLIT>, and I prepare To foil his cunning<SPLIT>, and his force to dare<SPLIT>; With chosen foot his passage to forelay<SPLIT>, And place an ambush in the winding way<SPLIT>. Thou<SPLIT>, with thy Volscians<SPLIT>, face the Tuscan horse<SPLIT>; The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce With those of Tibur<SPLIT>, and the Latian band<SPLIT>, Subjected all to thy supreme command<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" This said<SPLIT>, he warns Messapus to the war<SPLIT>, Then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care<SPLIT>. All thus encourag'd<SPLIT>, his own troops he joins<SPLIT>, And hastes to prosecute his deep designs<SPLIT>.
Inclos'd with hills<SPLIT>, a winding valley lies<SPLIT>, By nature form'd for fraud<SPLIT>, and fitted for surprise<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>narrow track<SPLIT>, by human steps untrode<SPLIT>, Leads<SPLIT>, thro<SPLIT>' perplexing thorns<SPLIT>, to this obscure abode<SPLIT>. High o<SPLIT>'er the vale a steepy mountain stands<SPLIT>, Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands<SPLIT>.

Thither young Turnus took the well-known way<SPLIT>, Possess'd the pass<SPLIT>, and in blind ambush lay<SPLIT>.
Meantime Latonian Phoebe<SPLIT>, from the skies<SPLIT>, Beheld th<SPLIT>' approaching war with hateful eyes<SPLIT>, And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid<SPLIT>, Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid<SPLIT>; Then with a sigh began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Camilla goes To meet her death amidst her fatal foes<SPLIT>: The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train<SPLIT>, Invested with Diana<SPLIT>'s arms<SPLIT>, in vain<SPLIT>.

Thro<SPLIT>' the woods he flies<SPLIT>; Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies<SPLIT>.

The raging flood his farther flight restrains<SPLIT>, Rais'd o<SPLIT>'er the borders with unusual rains<SPLIT>.

Anxious<SPLIT>, he stops a while<SPLIT>, and thinks in haste<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, desp'rate in distress<SPLIT>, resolves at last<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore<SPLIT>; The middle part with cork he cover'd o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>: He clos'd the child within the hollow space<SPLIT>; With twigs of bending osier bound the case<SPLIT>; Then pois'd the spear<SPLIT>, heavy with human weight<SPLIT>, And thus invok'd my favor for the freight<SPLIT>: 'Accept<SPLIT>, great goddess of the woods<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>' he said<SPLIT>, '<SPLIT>Sent by her sire<SPLIT>, this dedicated maid<SPLIT>! Thro<SPLIT>' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine<SPLIT>; And the first weapons that she knows<SPLIT>, are thine<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>' He said<SPLIT>; and with full force the spear he threw<SPLIT>: Above the sounding waves Camilla flew<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, press'd by foes<SPLIT>, he stemm'd the stormy tide<SPLIT>, And gain'd<SPLIT>, by stress of arms<SPLIT>, the farther side<SPLIT>. His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, victor of his vows<SPLIT>, his infant nymph unbound<SPLIT>; Nor<SPLIT>, after that<SPLIT>, in towns which walls inclose<SPLIT>, Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, rough<SPLIT>, in open air he chose to lie<SPLIT>; Earth was his couch<SPLIT>, his cov'ring was the sky<SPLIT>.

Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound<SPLIT>; Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground<SPLIT>. Instead of these<SPLIT>, a tiger<SPLIT>'s hide o<SPLIT>'erspread Her back and shoulders<SPLIT>, fasten'd to her head<SPLIT>. The flying dart she first attempts to fling<SPLIT>, And round her tender temples toss'd the sling<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, as her strength with years increas'd<SPLIT>, began To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan<SPLIT>, And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane<SPLIT>. The Tuscan matrons with each other vied<SPLIT>, To bless their rival sons with such a bride<SPLIT>; But she disdains their love<SPLIT>, to share with me The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity<SPLIT>.

Then<SPLIT>, in a hollow cloud<SPLIT>, myself will aid To bear the breathless body of my maid<SPLIT>: Unspoil'd shall be her arms<SPLIT>, and unprofan'd Her holy limbs with any human hand<SPLIT>, And in a marble tomb laid in her native land<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
She said<SPLIT>. The faithful nymph descends from high With rapid flight<SPLIT>, and cuts the sounding sky<SPLIT>: Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly<SPLIT>.
By this<SPLIT>, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse<SPLIT>, Drawn up in squadrons<SPLIT>, with united force<SPLIT>, Approach the walls<SPLIT>: the sprightly coursers bound<SPLIT>, Press forward on their bits<SPLIT>, and shift their ground<SPLIT>. Shields<SPLIT>, arms<SPLIT>, and spears flash horribly from far<SPLIT>; And the fields glitter with a waving war<SPLIT>. Oppos'd to these<SPLIT>, come on with furious force Messapus<SPLIT>, Coras<SPLIT>, and the Latian horse<SPLIT>; These in the body plac'd<SPLIT>, on either hand Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla<SPLIT>'s band<SPLIT>. Advancing in a line<SPLIT>, they couch their spears<SPLIT>; And less and less the middle space appears<SPLIT>. Thick smoke obscures the field<SPLIT>; and scarce are seen The neighing coursers<SPLIT>, and the shouting men<SPLIT>. In distance of their darts they stop their course<SPLIT>; Then man to man they rush<SPLIT>, and horse to horse<SPLIT>. The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide<SPLIT>, And deaths unseen are dealt on either side<SPLIT>. Tyrrhenus<SPLIT>, and Aconteus<SPLIT>, void of fear<SPLIT>, By mettled coursers borne in full career<SPLIT>, Meet first oppos'd<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, with a mighty shock<SPLIT>, Their horses<SPLIT>' heads against each other knock<SPLIT>. Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast<SPLIT>, As with an engine<SPLIT>'s force<SPLIT>, or lightning<SPLIT>'s blast<SPLIT>: He rolls along in blood<SPLIT>, and breathes his last<SPLIT>. The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright<SPLIT>, And sling their shields behind<SPLIT>, to save their backs in flight Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew<SPLIT>; Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue<SPLIT>, And urge their flight<SPLIT>: Asylas leads the chase<SPLIT>; Till<SPLIT>, seiz'd<SPLIT>, with shame<SPLIT>, they wheel about and face<SPLIT>, Receive their foes<SPLIT>, and raise a threat<SPLIT>'ning cry<SPLIT>. The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly<SPLIT>. So swelling surges<SPLIT>, with a thund<SPLIT>'ring roar<SPLIT>, Driv'n on each other<SPLIT>'s backs<SPLIT>, insult the shore<SPLIT>, Bound o<SPLIT>'er the rocks<SPLIT>, incroach upon the land<SPLIT>, And far upon the beach eject the sand<SPLIT>; Then backward<SPLIT>, with a swing<SPLIT>, they take their way<SPLIT>, Repuls'd from upper ground<SPLIT>, and seek their mother sea<SPLIT>; With equal hurry quit th<SPLIT>' invaded shore<SPLIT>, And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before<SPLIT>.
Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field<SPLIT>, Twice by the Latins<SPLIT>, in their turn<SPLIT>, repell'd<SPLIT>. Asham'd at length<SPLIT>, to the third charge they ran<SPLIT>; Both hosts resolv'd<SPLIT>, and mingled man to man<SPLIT>. Now dying groans are heard<SPLIT>; the fields are strow'd With falling bodies<SPLIT>, and are drunk with blood<SPLIT>. Arms<SPLIT>, horses<SPLIT>, men<SPLIT>, on heaps together lie<SPLIT>: Confus'd the fight<SPLIT>, and more confus'd the cry<SPLIT>. Orsilochus<SPLIT>, who durst not press too near Strong Remulus<SPLIT>, at distance drove his spear<SPLIT>, And stuck the steel beneath his horse<SPLIT>'s ear<SPLIT>. The fiery steed<SPLIT>, impatient of the wound<SPLIT>, Curvets<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, springing upward with a bound<SPLIT>, His helpless lord cast backward on the ground<SPLIT>. Catillus pierc'd Iolas first<SPLIT>; then drew His reeking lance<SPLIT>, and at Herminius threw<SPLIT>, The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew<SPLIT>. His neck and throat unarm'd<SPLIT>, his head was bare<SPLIT>, But shaded with a length of yellow hair<SPLIT>: Secure<SPLIT>, he fought<SPLIT>, expos'd on ev'ry part<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>spacious mark for swords<SPLIT>, and for the flying dart<SPLIT>. Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound<SPLIT>; Transfix'd he fell<SPLIT>, and doubled to the ground<SPLIT>. The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed<SPLIT>, And death with honor sought on either side<SPLIT>.
Resistless thro<SPLIT>' the war Camilla rode<SPLIT>, In danger unappall'd<SPLIT>, and pleas'd with blood<SPLIT>. One side was bare for her exerted breast<SPLIT>; One shoulder with her painted quiver press'd<SPLIT>. Now from afar her fatal jav'lins play<SPLIT>; Now with her ax<SPLIT>'s edge she hews her way<SPLIT>: Diana<SPLIT>'s arms upon her shoulder sound<SPLIT>; And when<SPLIT>, too closely press'd<SPLIT>, she quits the ground<SPLIT>, From her bent bow she sends a backward wound<SPLIT>. Her maids<SPLIT>, in martial pomp<SPLIT>, on either side<SPLIT>, Larina<SPLIT>, Tulla<SPLIT>, fierce Tarpeia<SPLIT>, ride<SPLIT>: Italians all<SPLIT>; in peace<SPLIT>, their queen<SPLIT>'s delight<SPLIT>; In war<SPLIT>, the bold companions of the fight<SPLIT>. So march'd the Tracian Amazons of old<SPLIT>, When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd<SPLIT>: Such troops as these in shining arms were seen<SPLIT>, When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen<SPLIT>: Such to the field Penthisilea led<SPLIT>, From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled<SPLIT>; With such<SPLIT>, return'd triumphant from the war<SPLIT>, Her maids with cries attend the lofty car<SPLIT>; They clash with manly force their moony shields<SPLIT>; With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields<SPLIT>.
Who foremost<SPLIT>, and who last<SPLIT>, heroic maid<SPLIT>, On the cold earth were by thy courage laid<SPLIT>? Thy spear<SPLIT>, of mountain ash<SPLIT>, Eumenius first<SPLIT>, With fury driv'n<SPLIT>, from side to side transpierc'd<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>purple stream came spouting from the wound<SPLIT>; Bath'd in his blood he lies<SPLIT>, and bites the ground<SPLIT>. Liris and Pegasus at once she slew<SPLIT>: The former<SPLIT>, as the slacken'd reins he drew Of his faint steed<SPLIT>; the latter<SPLIT>, as he stretch'd His arm to prop his friend<SPLIT>, the jav'lin reach'd<SPLIT>. By the same weapon<SPLIT>, sent from the same hand<SPLIT>, Both fall together<SPLIT>, and both spurn the sand<SPLIT>. Amastrus next is added to the slain<SPLIT>: The rest in rout she follows o<SPLIT>'er the plain<SPLIT>: Tereus<SPLIT>, Harpalycus<SPLIT>, Demophoon<SPLIT>, And Chromis<SPLIT>, at full speed her fury shun<SPLIT>. Of all her deadly darts<SPLIT>, not one she lost<SPLIT>; Each was attended with a Trojan ghost<SPLIT>. Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed<SPLIT>, Swift for the chase<SPLIT>, and of Apulian breed<SPLIT>. Him from afar she spied<SPLIT>, in arms unknown<SPLIT>: O'er his broad back an ox<SPLIT>'s hide was thrown<SPLIT>; His helm a wolf<SPLIT>, whose gaping jaws were spread A<SPLIT>cov'ring for his cheeks<SPLIT>, and grinn'd around his head<SPLIT>, He clench'd within his hand an iron prong<SPLIT>, And tower'd above the rest<SPLIT>, conspicuous in the throng<SPLIT>. Him soon she singled from the flying train<SPLIT>, And slew with ease<SPLIT>; then thus insults the slain<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Vain hunter<SPLIT>, didst thou think thro<SPLIT>' woods to chase The savage herd<SPLIT>, a vile and trembling race<SPLIT>? Here cease thy vaunts<SPLIT>, and own my victory<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>woman warrior was too strong for thee<SPLIT>. Yet<SPLIT>, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>, Confessing great Camilla<SPLIT>, save thy shame<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew<SPLIT>, The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew<SPLIT>; But Butes breast to breast<SPLIT>: the spear descends Above the gorget<SPLIT>, where his helmet ends<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er the shield which his left side defends<SPLIT>. Orsilochus and she their courses ply<SPLIT>: He seems to follow<SPLIT>, and she seems to fly<SPLIT>; But in a narrower ring she makes the race<SPLIT>; And then he flies<SPLIT>, and she pursues the chase<SPLIT>. Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe<SPLIT>, She swings her ax<SPLIT>, and rises to the blow Full on the helm behind<SPLIT>, with such a sway The weapon falls<SPLIT>, the riven steel gives way<SPLIT>: He groans<SPLIT>, he roars<SPLIT>, he sues in vain for grace<SPLIT>; Brains<SPLIT>, mingled with his blood<SPLIT>, besmear his face<SPLIT>.
Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance<SPLIT>, To see his fall<SPLIT>; nor farther dares advance<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, fixing on the horrid maid his eye<SPLIT>, He stares<SPLIT>, and shakes<SPLIT>, and finds it vain to fly<SPLIT>; Yet<SPLIT>, like a true Ligurian<SPLIT>, born to cheat<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>At least while fortune favor'd his deceit<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Cries out aloud<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What courage have you shown<SPLIT>, Who trust your courser<SPLIT>'s strength<SPLIT>, and not your own<SPLIT>?

She glows with anger and disdain<SPLIT>, Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain<SPLIT>, And leaves her horse at large among her train<SPLIT>; With her drawn sword defies him to the field<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, marching<SPLIT>, lifts aloft her maiden shield<SPLIT>. The youth<SPLIT>, who thought his cunning did succeed<SPLIT>, Reins round his horse<SPLIT>, and urges all his speed<SPLIT>; Adds the remembrance of the spur<SPLIT>, and hides The goring rowels in his bleeding sides<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Vain fool<SPLIT>, and coward<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" cries the lofty maid<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid<SPLIT>! On others practice thy Ligurian arts<SPLIT>; Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts Are lost on me<SPLIT>: nor shalt thou safe retire<SPLIT>, With vaunting lies<SPLIT>, to thy fallacious sire<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" At this<SPLIT>, so fast her flying feet she sped<SPLIT>, That soon she strain'd beyond his horse<SPLIT>'s head<SPLIT>: Then turning short<SPLIT>, at once she seiz'd the rein<SPLIT>, And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain<SPLIT>. Not with more ease the falcon<SPLIT>, from above<SPLIT>, Trusses in middle air the trembling dove<SPLIT>, Then plumes the prey<SPLIT>, in her strong pounces bound<SPLIT>: The feathers<SPLIT>, foul with blood<SPLIT>, come tumbling to the ground<SPLIT>.
Now mighty Jove<SPLIT>, from his superior height<SPLIT>, With his broad eye surveys th<SPLIT>' unequal fight<SPLIT>.

The fiery Tarchon<SPLIT>, flying o<SPLIT>'er the plains<SPLIT>, Press'd in his arms the pond<SPLIT>'rous prey sustains<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, with his shorten'd spear<SPLIT>, explores around His jointed arms<SPLIT>, to fix a deadly wound<SPLIT>. Nor less the captive struggles for his life<SPLIT>: He writhes his body to prolong the strife<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, fencing for his naked throat<SPLIT>, exerts His utmost vigor<SPLIT>, and the point averts<SPLIT>.

With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe<SPLIT>; Gnossian his shafts<SPLIT>, and Lycian was his bow<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>golden helm his front and head surrounds A<SPLIT>gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds<SPLIT>. Gold<SPLIT>, weav'd with linen<SPLIT>, on his thighs he wore<SPLIT>, With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o<SPLIT>'er<SPLIT>, With golden buckles bound<SPLIT>, and gather'd up before<SPLIT>. Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes<SPLIT>, Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize<SPLIT>, Or that the temple might his trophies hold<SPLIT>, Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold<SPLIT>. Blind in her haste<SPLIT>, she chases him alone<SPLIT>. And seeks his life<SPLIT>, regardless of her own<SPLIT>.
This lucky moment the sly traitor chose<SPLIT>: Then<SPLIT>, starting from his ambush<SPLIT>, up he rose<SPLIT>, And threw<SPLIT>, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O patron of Socrates<SPLIT>' high abodes<SPLIT>, Phoebus<SPLIT>, the ruling pow'r among the gods<SPLIT>, Whom first we serve<SPLIT>, whole woods of unctuous pine Are fell'd for thee<SPLIT>, and to thy glory shine<SPLIT>; By thee protected with our naked soles<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' flames unsing'd we march<SPLIT>, and tread the kindled coals Give me<SPLIT>, propitious pow'r<SPLIT>, to wash away The stains of this dishonorable day<SPLIT>: Nor spoils<SPLIT>, nor triumph<SPLIT>, from the fact I claim<SPLIT>, But with my future actions trust my fame<SPLIT>. Let me<SPLIT>, by stealth<SPLIT>, this female plague o<SPLIT>'ercome<SPLIT>, And from the field return inglorious home<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Apollo heard<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, granting half his pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>, Shuffled in winds the rest<SPLIT>, and toss'd in empty air<SPLIT>. He gives the death desir'd<SPLIT>; his safe return By southern tempests to the seas is borne<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies<SPLIT>, Both armies on Camilla turn'd their eyes<SPLIT>, Directed by the sound<SPLIT>. Of either host<SPLIT>, Th' unhappy virgin<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' concern'd the most<SPLIT>, Was only deaf<SPLIT>; so greedy was she bent On golden spoils<SPLIT>, and on her prey intent<SPLIT>; Till in her pap the winged weapon stood Infix'd<SPLIT>, and deeply drunk the purple blood<SPLIT>. Her sad attendants hasten to sustain Their dying lady<SPLIT>, drooping on the plain<SPLIT>. Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies<SPLIT>, With beating heart<SPLIT>, and fear confus'd with joys<SPLIT>; Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow<SPLIT>, Or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe<SPLIT>. As<SPLIT>, when the wolf has torn a bullock<SPLIT>'s hide At unawares<SPLIT>, or ranch'd a shepherd<SPLIT>'s side<SPLIT>, Conscious of his audacious deed<SPLIT>, he flies<SPLIT>, And claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs<SPLIT>: So<SPLIT>, speeding once<SPLIT>, the wretch no more attends<SPLIT>, But<SPLIT>, spurring forward<SPLIT>, herds among his friends<SPLIT>.
She wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands<SPLIT>, But wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands<SPLIT>; The wood she draws<SPLIT>, the steely point remains<SPLIT>; She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains<SPLIT>: (<SPLIT>A gath'ring mist o<SPLIT>'erclouds her cheerful eyes<SPLIT>, And from her cheeks the rosy color flies<SPLIT>:<SPLIT>) Then turns to her<SPLIT>, whom of her female train She trusted most<SPLIT>, and thus she speaks with pain<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Acca<SPLIT>, 't is past<SPLIT>! he swims before my sight<SPLIT>, Inexorable Death<SPLIT>; and claims his right<SPLIT>. Bear my last words to Turnus<SPLIT>; fly with speed<SPLIT>, And bid him timely to my charge succeed<SPLIT>, Repel the Trojans<SPLIT>, and the town relieve<SPLIT>: Farewell<SPLIT>! and in this kiss my parting breath receive<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" She said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, sliding<SPLIT>, sunk upon the plain<SPLIT>: Dying<SPLIT>, her open'd hand forsakes the rein<SPLIT>; Short<SPLIT>, and more short<SPLIT>, she pants<SPLIT>; by slow degrees Her mind the passage from her body frees<SPLIT>. She drops her sword<SPLIT>; she nods her plumy crest<SPLIT>, Her drooping head declining on her breast<SPLIT>: In the last sigh her struggling soul expires<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, murm<SPLIT>'ring with disdain<SPLIT>, to Stygian sounds retires<SPLIT>.
A<SPLIT>shout<SPLIT>, that struck the golden stars<SPLIT>, ensued<SPLIT>; Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd<SPLIT>. The Trojan troops and Tuscans<SPLIT>, in a line<SPLIT>, Advance to charge<SPLIT>; the mix'd Arcadians join<SPLIT>.
But Cynthia<SPLIT>'s maid<SPLIT>, high seated<SPLIT>, from afar Surveys the field<SPLIT>, and fortune of the war<SPLIT>, Unmov'd a while<SPLIT>, till<SPLIT>, prostrate on the plain<SPLIT>, Welt<SPLIT>'ring in blood<SPLIT>, she sees Camilla slain<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, round her corpse<SPLIT>, of friends and foes a fighting train<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, from the bottom of her breast<SPLIT>, she drew A<SPLIT>mournful sigh<SPLIT>, and these sad words ensue<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Too dear a fine<SPLIT>, ah much lamented maid<SPLIT>, For warring with the Trojans<SPLIT>, thou hast paid<SPLIT>! Nor aught avail'd<SPLIT>, in this unhappy strife<SPLIT>, Diana<SPLIT>'s sacred arms<SPLIT>, to save thy life<SPLIT>. Yet unreveng'd thy goddess will not leave Her vot<SPLIT>'ry<SPLIT>'s death<SPLIT>, nor<SPLIT>; with vain sorrow grieve<SPLIT>. Branded the wretch<SPLIT>, and be his name abhorr'd<SPLIT>; But after ages shall thy praise record<SPLIT>. Th' inglorious coward soon shall press the plain<SPLIT>: Thus vows thy queen<SPLIT>, and thus the Fates ordain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
High o<SPLIT>'er the field there stood a hilly mound<SPLIT>, Sacred the place<SPLIT>, and spread with oaks around<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>, in a marble tomb<SPLIT>, Dercennus lay<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>king that once in Latium bore the sway<SPLIT>. The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight<SPLIT>, To mark the traitor Aruns from the height<SPLIT>. Him in refulgent arms she soon espied<SPLIT>, Swoln with success<SPLIT>; and loudly thus she cried<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Thy backward steps<SPLIT>, vain boaster<SPLIT>, are too late<SPLIT>; Turn like a man<SPLIT>, at length<SPLIT>, and meet thy fate<SPLIT>. Charg'd with my message<SPLIT>, to Camilla go<SPLIT>, And say I sent thee to the shades below<SPLIT>, An honor undeserv'd from Cynthia<SPLIT>'s bow<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
She said<SPLIT>, and from her quiver chose with speed The winged shaft<SPLIT>, predestin'd for the deed<SPLIT>; Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied<SPLIT>, Till the far distant horns approach'd on either side<SPLIT>. The bowstring touch'd her breast<SPLIT>, so strong she drew<SPLIT>; Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew<SPLIT>. At once the twanging bow and sounding dart The traitor heard<SPLIT>, and felt the point within his heart<SPLIT>. Him<SPLIT>, beating with his heels in pangs of death<SPLIT>, His flying friends to foreign fields bequeath<SPLIT>. The conqu'ring damsel<SPLIT>, with expanded wings<SPLIT>, The welcome message to her mistress brings<SPLIT>.
Their leader lost<SPLIT>, the Volscians quit the field<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, unsustain'd<SPLIT>, the chiefs of Turnus yield<SPLIT>. The frighted soldiers<SPLIT>, when their captains fly<SPLIT>, More on their speed than on their strength rely<SPLIT>. Confus'd in flight<SPLIT>, they bear each other down<SPLIT>, And spur their horses headlong to the town<SPLIT>. Driv'n by their foes<SPLIT>, and to their fears resign'd<SPLIT>, Not once they turn<SPLIT>, but take their wounds behind<SPLIT>. These drop the shield<SPLIT>, and those the lance forego<SPLIT>, Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow<SPLIT>. The hoofs of horses<SPLIT>, with a rattling sound<SPLIT>, Beat short and thick<SPLIT>, and shake the rotten ground<SPLIT>. Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly<SPLIT>. The trembling matrons<SPLIT>, from their lofty stands<SPLIT>, Rend heav'n with female shrieks<SPLIT>, and wring their hands<SPLIT>. All pressing on<SPLIT>, pursuers and pursued<SPLIT>, Are crush'd in crowds<SPLIT>, a mingled multitude<SPLIT>. Some happy few escape<SPLIT>: the throng too late Rush on for entrance<SPLIT>, till they choke the gate<SPLIT>. Ev'n in the sight of home<SPLIT>, the wretched sire Looks on<SPLIT>, and sees his helpless son expire<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, in a fright<SPLIT>, the folding gates they close<SPLIT>, But leave their friends excluded with their foes<SPLIT>. The vanquish'd cry<SPLIT>; the victors loudly shout<SPLIT>; '<SPLIT>T is terror all within<SPLIT>, and slaughter all without<SPLIT>. Blind in their fear<SPLIT>, they bounce against the wall<SPLIT>, Or<SPLIT>, to the moats pursued<SPLIT>, precipitate their fall<SPLIT>.
The Latian virgins<SPLIT>, valiant with despair<SPLIT>, Arm'd on the tow'rs<SPLIT>, the common danger share<SPLIT>: So much of zeal their country<SPLIT>'s cause inspir'd<SPLIT>; So much Camilla<SPLIT>'s great example fir'd<SPLIT>. Poles<SPLIT>, sharpen'd in the flames<SPLIT>, from high they throw<SPLIT>, With imitated darts<SPLIT>, to gall the foe<SPLIT>. Their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath<SPLIT>, And crowd each other to be first in death<SPLIT>. Meantime to Turnus<SPLIT>, ambush'd in the shade<SPLIT>, With heavy tidings came th<SPLIT>' unhappy maid<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The Volscians overthrown<SPLIT>, Camilla kill'd<SPLIT>; The foes<SPLIT>, entirely masters of the field<SPLIT>, Like a resistless flood<SPLIT>, come rolling on<SPLIT>: The cry goes off the plain<SPLIT>, and thickens to the town<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Inflam'd with rage<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>for so the Furies fire The Daunian<SPLIT>'s breast<SPLIT>, and so the Fates require<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) He leaves the hilly pass<SPLIT>, the woods in vain Possess'd<SPLIT>, and downward issues on the plain<SPLIT>. Scarce was he gone<SPLIT>, when to the straits<SPLIT>, now freed From secret foes<SPLIT>, the Trojan troops succeed<SPLIT>. Thro<SPLIT>' the black forest and the ferny brake<SPLIT>, Unknowingly secure<SPLIT>, their way they take<SPLIT>; From the rough mountains to the plain descend<SPLIT>, And there<SPLIT>, in order drawn<SPLIT>, their line extend<SPLIT>. Both armies now in open fields are seen<SPLIT>; Nor far the distance of the space between<SPLIT>. Both to the city bend<SPLIT>. Aeneas sees<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' smoking fields<SPLIT>, his has<SPLIT>t<SPLIT>'ning enemies<SPLIT>; And Turnus views the Trojans in array<SPLIT>, And hears th<SPLIT>' approaching horses proudly neigh<SPLIT>. Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd<SPLIT>; But westward to the sea the sun declin'd<SPLIT>. Intrench'd before the town both armies lie<SPLIT>, While Night with sable wings involves the sky<SPLIT>.

BOOK XII
When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field<SPLIT>, Their armies broken<SPLIT>, and their courage quell'd<SPLIT>, Himself become the mark of public spite<SPLIT>, His honor question'd for the promis'd fight<SPLIT>; The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd<SPLIT>, The more his fury boil'd within his breast<SPLIT>: He rous'd his vigor for the last debate<SPLIT>, And rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate<SPLIT>.
As<SPLIT>, when the swains the Libyan lion chase<SPLIT>, He makes a sour retreat<SPLIT>, nor mends his pace<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side<SPLIT>, The lordly beast returns with double pride<SPLIT>: He wrenches out the steel<SPLIT>, he roars for pain<SPLIT>; His sides he lashes<SPLIT>, and erects his mane<SPLIT>: So Turnus fares<SPLIT>; his eyeballs flash with fire<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire<SPLIT>.
Trembling with rage<SPLIT>, around the court he ran<SPLIT>, At length approach'd the king<SPLIT>, and thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>No more excuses or delays<SPLIT>: I stand In arms prepar'd to combat<SPLIT>, hand to hand<SPLIT>, This base deserter of his native land<SPLIT>. The Trojan<SPLIT>, by his word<SPLIT>, is bound to take The same conditions which himself did make<SPLIT>. Renew the truce<SPLIT>; the solemn rites prepare<SPLIT>, And to my single virtue trust the war<SPLIT>. The Latians unconcer<SPLIT>n'd shall see the fight<SPLIT>; This arm unaided shall assert your right<SPLIT>: Then<SPLIT>, if my prostrate body press the plain<SPLIT>, To him the crown and beauteous bride remain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
To whom the king sedately thus replied<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Brave youth<SPLIT>, the more your valor has been tried<SPLIT>, The more becomes it us<SPLIT>, with due respect<SPLIT>, To weigh the chance of war<SPLIT>, which you neglect<SPLIT>. You want not wealth<SPLIT>, or a successive throne<SPLIT>, Or cities which your arms have made your own<SPLIT>: My towns and treasures are at your command<SPLIT>, And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land<SPLIT>; Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees<SPLIT>, Unmarried<SPLIT>, fair<SPLIT>, of noble families<SPLIT>. Now let me speak<SPLIT>, and you with patience hear<SPLIT>, Things which perhaps may grate a lover<SPLIT>'s ear<SPLIT>, But sound advice<SPLIT>, proceeding from a heart Sincerely yours<SPLIT>, and free from fraudful art<SPLIT>. The gods<SPLIT>, by signs<SPLIT>, have manifestly shown<SPLIT>, No prince Italian born should heir my throne<SPLIT>: Oft have our augurs<SPLIT>, in prediction skill'd<SPLIT>, And oft our priests<SPLIT>, foreign son reveal'd<SPLIT>. Yet<SPLIT>, won by worth that cannot be withstood<SPLIT>, Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood<SPLIT>, Urg'd by my wife<SPLIT>, who would not be denied<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>promis'd my Lavinia for your bride<SPLIT>: Her from her plighted lord by force I took<SPLIT>; All ties of treaties<SPLIT>, and of honor<SPLIT>, broke<SPLIT>: On your account I wag'd an impious war- With what success<SPLIT>, 't is needless to declare<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>and my subjects feel<SPLIT>, and you have had your share<SPLIT>. Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive<SPLIT>, Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive<SPLIT>: The rolling flood runs warm with human gore<SPLIT>; The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore<SPLIT>. Why put I not an end to this debate<SPLIT>, Still unresolv'd<SPLIT>, and still a slave to fate<SPLIT>? If Turnus<SPLIT>' death a lasting peace can give<SPLIT>, Why should I not procure it whilst you live<SPLIT>? Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray<SPLIT>, What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say<SPLIT>? And<SPLIT>, should you fall in fight<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>which Heav'n defend<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>) How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end The daughter<SPLIT>'s lover and the father<SPLIT>'s friend<SPLIT>? Weigh in your mind the various chance of war<SPLIT>; Pity your parent<SPLIT>'s age<SPLIT>, and ease his care<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Such balmy words he pour'd<SPLIT>, but all in vain<SPLIT>: The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain<SPLIT>. The wrathful youth<SPLIT>, disdaining the relief<SPLIT>, With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The care<SPLIT>, O best of fathers<SPLIT>, which you take For my concerns<SPLIT>, at my desire forsake<SPLIT>. Permit me not to languish out my days<SPLIT>, But make the best exchange of life for praise<SPLIT>. This arm<SPLIT>, this lance<SPLIT>, can well dispute the prize<SPLIT>; And the blood follows<SPLIT>, where the weapon flies<SPLIT>. His goddess mother is not near<SPLIT>, to shroud The flying coward with an empty cloud<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
But now the queen<SPLIT>, who fear'd for Turnus<SPLIT>' life<SPLIT>, And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife<SPLIT>, Held him by force<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, dying in his death<SPLIT>, In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O Turnus<SPLIT>, I adjure thee by these tears<SPLIT>, And whate<SPLIT>'er price Amata<SPLIT>'s honor bears Within thy breast<SPLIT>, since thou art all my hope<SPLIT>, My sickly mind<SPLIT>'s repose<SPLIT>, my sinking age<SPLIT>'s prop<SPLIT>; Since on the safety of thy life alone Depends Latinus<SPLIT>, and the Latian throne<SPLIT>: Refuse me not this one<SPLIT>, this only pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>, To waive the combat<SPLIT>, and pursue the war<SPLIT>. Whatever chance attends this fatal strife<SPLIT>, Think it includes<SPLIT>, in thine<SPLIT>, Amata<SPLIT>'s life<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>cannot live a slave<SPLIT>, or see my throne Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
At this<SPLIT>, a flood of tears Lavinia shed<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>crimson blush her beauteous face o<SPLIT>'erspread<SPLIT>, Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red<SPLIT>. The driving colors<SPLIT>, never at a stay<SPLIT>, Run here and there<SPLIT>, and flush<SPLIT>, and fade away<SPLIT>. Delightful change<SPLIT>! Thus Indian iv'ry shows<SPLIT>, Which with the bord<SPLIT>'ring paint of purple glows<SPLIT>; Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose<SPLIT>.
The lover gaz'd<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, burning with desire<SPLIT>, The more he look'd<SPLIT>, the more he fed the fire<SPLIT>: Revenge<SPLIT>, and jealous rage<SPLIT>, and secret spite<SPLIT>, Roll in his breast<SPLIT>, and rouse him to the fight<SPLIT>. Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes<SPLIT>, Firm to his first intent<SPLIT>, he thus replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O mother<SPLIT>, do not by your tears prepare Such boding omens<SPLIT>, and prejudge the war<SPLIT>. Resolv'd on fight<SPLIT>, I am no longer free To shun my death<SPLIT>, if Heav'n my death decree<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Then turning to the herald<SPLIT>, thus pursues<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Go<SPLIT>, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news<SPLIT>; Denounce from me<SPLIT>, that<SPLIT>, when to-morrow<SPLIT>'s light Shall gild the heav'ns<SPLIT>, he need not urge the fight<SPLIT>; The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more Shall dye<SPLIT>, with mutual blood<SPLIT>, the Latian shore<SPLIT>: Our single swords the quarrel shall decide<SPLIT>, And to the victor be the beauteous bride<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>, and striding on<SPLIT>, with speedy pace<SPLIT>, He sought his coursers of the Thracian race<SPLIT>. At his approach they toss their heads on high<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, proudly neighing<SPLIT>, promise victory<SPLIT>. The sires of these Orythia sent from far<SPLIT>, To grace Pilumnus<SPLIT>, when he went to war<SPLIT>. The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white<SPLIT>, Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight<SPLIT>. Officious grooms stand ready by his side<SPLIT>; And some with combs their flowing manes divide<SPLIT>, And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride<SPLIT>.
He sheath'd his limbs in arms<SPLIT>; a temper'd mass Of golden metal those<SPLIT>, and mountain brass<SPLIT>. Then to his head his glitt<SPLIT>'ring helm he tied<SPLIT>, And girt his faithful fauchion to his side<SPLIT>. In his Aetnaean forge<SPLIT>, the God of Fire That fauchion labor'd for the hero<SPLIT>'s sire<SPLIT>; Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd<SPLIT>, And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood<SPLIT>. Propp'd on a pillar<SPLIT>, which the ceiling bore<SPLIT>, Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore<SPLIT>; Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand<SPLIT>, The tough ash trembled like an osier wand<SPLIT>: Then cried<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O pond<SPLIT>'rous spoil of Actor slain<SPLIT>, And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain<SPLIT>, Fail not this day thy wonted force<SPLIT>; but go<SPLIT>, Sent by this hand<SPLIT>, to pierce the Trojan foe<SPLIT>! Give me to tear his corslet from his breast<SPLIT>, And from that eunuch head to rend the crest<SPLIT>; Dragg'd in the dust<SPLIT>, his frizzled hair to soil<SPLIT>, Hot from the vexing ir<SPLIT>'n<SPLIT>, and smear'd with fragrant oil<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
Thus while he raves<SPLIT>, from his wide nostrils flies A<SPLIT>fiery steam<SPLIT>, and sparkles from his eyes<SPLIT>. So fares the bull in his lov'd female<SPLIT>'s sight<SPLIT>: Proudly he bellows<SPLIT>, and preludes the fight<SPLIT>; He tries his goring horns against a tree<SPLIT>, And meditates his absent enemy<SPLIT>; He pushes at the winds<SPLIT>; he digs the strand With his black hoofs<SPLIT>, and spurns the yellow sand<SPLIT>.
Nor less the Trojan<SPLIT>, in his Lemnian arms<SPLIT>, To future fight his manly courage warms<SPLIT>: He whets his fury<SPLIT>, and with joy prepares To terminate at once the ling<SPLIT>'ring wars<SPLIT>; To cheer his chiefs and tender son<SPLIT>, relates What Heav'n had promis'd<SPLIT>, and expounds the fates<SPLIT>. Then to the Latian king he sends<SPLIT>, to cease The rage of arms<SPLIT>, and ratify the peace<SPLIT>.
The morn ensuing<SPLIT>, from the mountain<SPLIT>'s height<SPLIT>, Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light<SPLIT>; Th' ethereal coursers<SPLIT>, bounding from the sea<SPLIT>, From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day<SPLIT>; When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard<SPLIT>, In friendly labor join'd<SPLIT>, the list prepar'd<SPLIT>. Beneath the walls they measure out the space<SPLIT>; Then sacred altars rear<SPLIT>, on sods of grass<SPLIT>, Where<SPLIT>, with religious their common gods they place<SPLIT>. In purest white the priests their heads attire<SPLIT>; And living waters bear<SPLIT>, and holy fire<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'er their linen hoods and shaded hair<SPLIT>, Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear<SPLIT>.
In order issuing from the town appears The Latin legion<SPLIT>, arm'd with pointed spears<SPLIT>; And from the fields<SPLIT>, advancing on a line<SPLIT>, The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join<SPLIT>: Their various arms afford a pleasing sight<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>peaceful train they seem<SPLIT>, in peace prepar'd for fight<SPLIT>. Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride<SPLIT>, Glitt<SPLIT>'ring with gold<SPLIT>, and vests in purple dyed<SPLIT>; Here Mnestheus<SPLIT>, author of the Memmian line<SPLIT>, And there Messapus<SPLIT>, born of seed divine<SPLIT>. The sign is giv'n<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, round the listed space<SPLIT>, Each man in order fills his proper place<SPLIT>. Reclining on their ample shields<SPLIT>, they stand<SPLIT>, And fix their pointed lances in the sand<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, studious of the sight<SPLIT>, a num<SPLIT>'rous throng Of either sex promiscuous<SPLIT>, old and young<SPLIT>, Swarm the town<SPLIT>: by those who rest behind<SPLIT>, The gates and walls and houses<SPLIT>' tops are lin'd<SPLIT>. Meantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight<SPLIT>, With eyes unpleas'd<SPLIT>, from Mount Albano<SPLIT>'s height (<SPLIT>Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame<SPLIT>, But then an empty hill<SPLIT>, without a name<SPLIT>)<SPLIT>. She thence survey'd the field<SPLIT>, the Trojan pow'rs<SPLIT>, The Latian squadrons<SPLIT>, and Laurentine tow'rs<SPLIT>. Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke<SPLIT>, With sighs and tears<SPLIT>, the goddess of the lake<SPLIT>, King Turnus<SPLIT>' sister<SPLIT>, once a lovely maid<SPLIT>, Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray'd<SPLIT>: Compress'd by force<SPLIT>, but<SPLIT>, by the grateful god<SPLIT>, Now made the Nais of the neighb'ring flood<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>O nymph<SPLIT>, the pride of living lakes<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said she<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>O most renown'd<SPLIT>, and most belov'd by me<SPLIT>, Long hast thou known<SPLIT>, nor need I to record<SPLIT>, The wanton sallies of my wand<SPLIT>'ring lord<SPLIT>. Of ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled To mount by stealth my violated bed<SPLIT>, To thee alone I grudg'd not his embrace<SPLIT>, But gave a part of heav'n<SPLIT>, and an unenvied place<SPLIT>. Now learn from me thy near approaching grief<SPLIT>, Nor think my wishes want to thy relief<SPLIT>. While fortune favor'd<SPLIT>, nor Heav'n<SPLIT>'s King denied To lend my succor to the Latian side<SPLIT>, I<SPLIT>sav'd thy brother<SPLIT>, and the sinking state<SPLIT>: But now he struggles with unequal fate<SPLIT>, And goes<SPLIT>, with gods averse<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'ermatch'd in might<SPLIT>, To meet inevitable death in fight<SPLIT>; Nor must I break the truce<SPLIT>, nor can sustain the sight<SPLIT>. Thou<SPLIT>, if thou dar<SPLIT>'st thy present aid supply<SPLIT>; It well becomes a sister<SPLIT>'s care to try<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
At this the lovely nymph<SPLIT>, with grief oppress'd<SPLIT>, Thrice tore her hair<SPLIT>, and beat her comely breast<SPLIT>. To whom Saturnia thus<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Thy tears are late<SPLIT>: Haste<SPLIT>, snatch him<SPLIT>, if he can be snatch'd from fate<SPLIT>: New tumults kindle<SPLIT>; violate the truce<SPLIT>: Who knows what changeful fortune may produce<SPLIT>? '<SPLIT>T is not a crime t<SPLIT>' attempt what I decree<SPLIT>; Or<SPLIT>, if it were<SPLIT>, discharge the crime on me<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" She said<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, sailing on the winged wind<SPLIT>, Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind<SPLIT>.
And now pomp the peaceful kings appear<SPLIT>: Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear<SPLIT>; Twelve golden beams around his temples play<SPLIT>, To mark his lineage from the God of Day<SPLIT>. Two snowy coursers Turnus<SPLIT>' chariot yoke<SPLIT>, And in his hand two massy spears he shook<SPLIT>: Then issued from the camp<SPLIT>, in arms divine<SPLIT>, Aeneas<SPLIT>, author of the Roman line<SPLIT>; And by his side Ascanius took his place<SPLIT>, The second hope of Rome<SPLIT>'s immortal race<SPLIT>. Adorn'd in white<SPLIT>, a rev'rend priest appears<SPLIT>, And off'rings to the flaming altars bears<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>porket<SPLIT>, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears<SPLIT>. Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes<SPLIT>, And strews the beasts<SPLIT>, design'd for sacrifice<SPLIT>, With salt and meal<SPLIT>: with like officious care He marks their foreheads<SPLIT>, and he clips their hair<SPLIT>. Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds<SPLIT>; With the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds<SPLIT>.
Aeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword<SPLIT>, And thus with pious pray<SPLIT>'rs the gods ador'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>All-seeing sun<SPLIT>, and thou<SPLIT>, Ausonian soil<SPLIT>, For which I have sustain'd so long a toil<SPLIT>, Thou<SPLIT>, King of Heav'n<SPLIT>, and thou<SPLIT>, the Queen of Air<SPLIT>, Propitious now<SPLIT>, and reconcil'd by pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>; Thou<SPLIT>, God of War<SPLIT>, whose unresisted sway The labors and events of arms obey<SPLIT>; Ye living fountains<SPLIT>, and ye running floods<SPLIT>, All pow'rs of ocean<SPLIT>, all ethereal gods<SPLIT>, Hear<SPLIT>, and bear record<SPLIT>: if I fall in field<SPLIT>, Or<SPLIT>, recreant in the fight<SPLIT>, to Turnus yield<SPLIT>, My Trojans shall encrease Evander<SPLIT>'s town<SPLIT>; Ascanius shall renounce th<SPLIT>' Ausonian crown<SPLIT>: All claims<SPLIT>, all questions of debate<SPLIT>, shall cease<SPLIT>; Nor he<SPLIT>, nor they<SPLIT>, with force infringe the peace<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, if my juster arms prevail in fight<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>As sure they shall<SPLIT>, if I divine aright<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) My Trojans shall not o<SPLIT>'er th<SPLIT>' Italians reign<SPLIT>: Both equal<SPLIT>, both unconquer'd shall remain<SPLIT>, Join'd in their laws<SPLIT>, their lands<SPLIT>, and their abodes<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>ask but altars for my weary gods<SPLIT>. The care of those religious rites be mine<SPLIT>; The crown to King Latinus I resign<SPLIT>: His be the sov'reign sway<SPLIT>. Nor will I share His pow'r in peace<SPLIT>, or his command in war<SPLIT>. For me<SPLIT>, my friends another town shall frame<SPLIT>, And bless the rising tow'rs with fair Lavinia<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus he<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, with erected eyes and hands<SPLIT>, The Latian king before his altar stands<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>By the same heav'n<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>and earth<SPLIT>, and main<SPLIT>, And all the pow'rs that all the three contain<SPLIT>; By hell below<SPLIT>, and by that upper god Whose thunder signs the peace<SPLIT>, who seals it with his nod<SPLIT>; So let Latona<SPLIT>'s double offspring hear<SPLIT>, And double-fronted Janus<SPLIT>, what I swear<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>touch the sacred altars<SPLIT>, touch the flames<SPLIT>, And all those pow'rs attest<SPLIT>, and all their names<SPLIT>; Whatever chance befall on either side<SPLIT>, No term of time this union shall divide<SPLIT>: No force<SPLIT>, no fortune<SPLIT>, shall my vows unbind<SPLIT>, Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind<SPLIT>; Not tho<SPLIT>' the circling seas should break their bound<SPLIT>, O'erflow the shores<SPLIT>, or sap the solid ground<SPLIT>; Not tho<SPLIT>' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake<SPLIT>, Hurl'd down<SPLIT>, and hissing in the nether lake<SPLIT>: Ev'n as this royal scepter<SPLIT>" (<SPLIT>for he bore A<SPLIT>scepter in his hand<SPLIT>) "<SPLIT>shall never more Shoot out in branches<SPLIT>, or renew the birth<SPLIT>: An orphan now<SPLIT>, cut from the mother earth By the keen ax<SPLIT>, dishonor'd of its hair<SPLIT>, And cas'd in brass<SPLIT>, for Latian kings to bear<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
When thus in public view the peace was tied With solemn vows<SPLIT>, and sworn on either side<SPLIT>, All dues perform'd which holy rites require<SPLIT>; The victim beasts are slain before the fire<SPLIT>, The trembling entrails from their bodies torn<SPLIT>, And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne<SPLIT>.
Already the Rutulians deem their man O'ermatch'd in arms<SPLIT>, before the fight began<SPLIT>. First rising fears are whisper'd thro<SPLIT>' the crowd<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, gath'ring sound<SPLIT>, they murmur more aloud<SPLIT>. Now<SPLIT>, side to side<SPLIT>, they measure with their eyes The champions<SPLIT>' bulk<SPLIT>, their sinews<SPLIT>, and their size<SPLIT>: The nearer they approach<SPLIT>, the more is known Th' apparent disadvantage of their own<SPLIT>. Turnus himself appears in public sight Conscious of fate<SPLIT>, desponding of the fight<SPLIT>. Slowly he moves<SPLIT>, and at his altar stands With eyes dejected<SPLIT>, and with trembling hands<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>livid deadness in his cheeks appears<SPLIT>.
With anxious pleasure when Juturna view'd Th' increasing fright of the mad multitude<SPLIT>, When their short sighs and thick<SPLIT>'ning sobs she heard<SPLIT>, And found their ready minds for change prepar'd<SPLIT>; Dissembling her immortal form<SPLIT>, she took Camertus<SPLIT>' mien<SPLIT>, his habit<SPLIT>, and his look<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>chief of ancient blood<SPLIT>; in arms well known Was his great sire<SPLIT>, and he his greater son<SPLIT>. His shape assum'd<SPLIT>, amid the ranks she ran<SPLIT>, And humoring their first motions<SPLIT>, thus began<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>For shame<SPLIT>, Rutulians<SPLIT>, can you bear the sight Of one expos'd for all<SPLIT>, in single fight<SPLIT>? Can we<SPLIT>, before the face of heav'n<SPLIT>, confess Our courage colder<SPLIT>, or our numbers less<SPLIT>? View all the Trojan host<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' Arcadian band<SPLIT>, And Tuscan army<SPLIT>; count 'em as they stand<SPLIT>: Undaunted to the battle if we go<SPLIT>, Scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe<SPLIT>. Turnus<SPLIT>, 't is true<SPLIT>, in this unequal strife<SPLIT>, Shall lose<SPLIT>, with honor<SPLIT>, his devoted life<SPLIT>, Or change it rather for immortal fame<SPLIT>, Succeeding to the gods<SPLIT>, from whence he came<SPLIT>: But you<SPLIT>, a servile and inglorious band<SPLIT>, For foreign lords shall sow your native land<SPLIT>, Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd<SPLIT>, Which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" With words like these<SPLIT>, she carried her design<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>rising murmur runs along the line<SPLIT>. Then ev'n the city troops<SPLIT>, and Latians<SPLIT>, tir'd With tedious war<SPLIT>, seem with new souls inspir'd<SPLIT>: Their champion<SPLIT>'s fate with pity they lament<SPLIT>, And of the league<SPLIT>, so lately sworn<SPLIT>, repent<SPLIT>.
Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage With lying wonders<SPLIT>, and a false presage<SPLIT>; But adds a sign<SPLIT>, which<SPLIT>, present to their eyes<SPLIT>, Inspires new courage<SPLIT>, and a glad surprise<SPLIT>. For<SPLIT>, sudden<SPLIT>, in the fiery tracts above<SPLIT>, Appears in pomp th<SPLIT>' imperial bird of Jove<SPLIT>: A<SPLIT>plump of fowl he spies<SPLIT>, that swim the lakes<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, stooping on the fairest of the train<SPLIT>, In his strong talons truss'd a silver swan<SPLIT>. Th' Italians wonder at th<SPLIT>' unusual sight<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, while he lags<SPLIT>, and labors in his flight<SPLIT>, Behold<SPLIT>, the dastard fowl return anew<SPLIT>, And with united force the foe pursue<SPLIT>: Clam<SPLIT>'rous around the royal hawk they fly<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, thick<SPLIT>'ning in a cloud<SPLIT>, o<SPLIT>'ershade the sky<SPLIT>. They cuff<SPLIT>, they scratch<SPLIT>, they cross his airy course<SPLIT>; Nor can th<SPLIT>' incumber'd bird sustain their force<SPLIT>; But vex'd<SPLIT>, not vanquish'd<SPLIT>, drops the pond<SPLIT>'rous prey<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, lighten'd of his burthen<SPLIT>, wings his way<SPLIT>.
Th' Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight<SPLIT>, Eager of action<SPLIT>, and demand the fight<SPLIT>. Then King Tolumnius<SPLIT>, vers'd in augurs<SPLIT>' arts<SPLIT>, Cries out<SPLIT>, and thus his boasted skill imparts<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>At length 't is granted<SPLIT>, what I long desir'd<SPLIT>! This<SPLIT>, this is what my frequent vows requir'd<SPLIT>. Ye gods<SPLIT>, I take your omen<SPLIT>, and obey<SPLIT>. Advance<SPLIT>, my friends<SPLIT>, and charge<SPLIT>! I lead the way<SPLIT>. These are the foreign foes<SPLIT>, whose impious band<SPLIT>, Like that rapacious bird<SPLIT>, infest our land<SPLIT>: But soon<SPLIT>, like him<SPLIT>, they shall be forc'd to sea By strength united<SPLIT>, and forego the prey<SPLIT>. Your timely succor to your country bring<SPLIT>, Haste to the rescue<SPLIT>, and redeem your king<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, pressing onward thro<SPLIT>' the crew<SPLIT>, Pois'd in his lifted arm<SPLIT>, his lance he threw<SPLIT>. The winged weapon<SPLIT>, whistling in the wind<SPLIT>, Came driving on<SPLIT>, nor miss'd the mark design'd<SPLIT>. At once the cornel rattled in the skies<SPLIT>; At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise<SPLIT>. Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood<SPLIT>, Born of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood<SPLIT>, Gylippus<SPLIT>' sons<SPLIT>: the fatal jav'lin flew<SPLIT>, Aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>passage thro<SPLIT>' the jointed arms it found<SPLIT>, Just where the belt was to the body bound<SPLIT>, And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, fir'd with pious rage<SPLIT>, the gen'rous train Run madly forward to revenge the slain<SPLIT>. And some with eager haste their jav'lins throw<SPLIT>; And some with sword in hand assault the foe<SPLIT>.
The wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace<SPLIT>, And meet their ardor in the middle space<SPLIT>. The Trojans<SPLIT>, Tuscans<SPLIT>, and Arcadian line<SPLIT>, With equal courage obviate their design<SPLIT>. Peace leaves the violated fields<SPLIT>, and hate Both armies urges to their mutual fate<SPLIT>. With impious haste their altars are o<SPLIT>'erturn'd<SPLIT>, The sacrifice half-broil'd<SPLIT>, and half-unburn'd<SPLIT>. Thick storms of steel from either army fly<SPLIT>, And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky<SPLIT>; Brands from the fire are missive weapons made<SPLIT>, With chargers<SPLIT>, bowls<SPLIT>, and all the priestly trade<SPLIT>. Latinus<SPLIT>, frighted<SPLIT>, hastens from the fray<SPLIT>, And bears his unregarded gods away<SPLIT>. These on their horses vault<SPLIT>; those yoke the car<SPLIT>; The rest<SPLIT>, with swords on high<SPLIT>, run headlong to the war<SPLIT>.
Messapus<SPLIT>, eager to confound the peace<SPLIT>, Spurr'd his hot courser thro<SPLIT>' the fighting prease<SPLIT>, At King Aulestes<SPLIT>, by his purple known A<SPLIT>Tuscan prince<SPLIT>, and by his regal crown<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, with a shock encount<SPLIT>'ring<SPLIT>, bore him down<SPLIT>. Backward he fell<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, as his fate design'd<SPLIT>, The ruins of an altar were behind<SPLIT>: There<SPLIT>, pitching on his shoulders and his head<SPLIT>, Amid the scatt<SPLIT>'ring fires he lay supinely spread<SPLIT>. The beamy spear<SPLIT>, descending from above<SPLIT>, His cuirass pierc'd<SPLIT>, and thro<SPLIT>' his body drove<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, with a scornful smile<SPLIT>, the victor cries<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>The gods have found a fitter sacrifice<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Greedy of spoils<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' Italians strip the dead Of his rich armor<SPLIT>, and uncrown his head<SPLIT>.
Priest Corynaeus<SPLIT>, arm'd his better hand<SPLIT>, From his own altar<SPLIT>, with a blazing brand<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, as Ebusus with a thund<SPLIT>'ring pace Advanc'd to battle<SPLIT>, dash'd it on his face<SPLIT>: His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires<SPLIT>; The crackling crop a noisome scent expires<SPLIT>. Following the blow<SPLIT>, he seiz'd his curling crown With his left hand<SPLIT>; his other cast him down<SPLIT>. The prostrate body with his knees he press'd<SPLIT>, And plung'd his holy poniard in his breast<SPLIT>.
While Podalirius<SPLIT>, with his sword<SPLIT>, pursued The shepherd Alsus thro<SPLIT>' the flying crowd<SPLIT>, Swiftly he turns<SPLIT>, and aims a deadly blow Full on the front of his unwary foe<SPLIT>. The broad ax enters with a crashing sound<SPLIT>, And cleaves the chin with one continued wound<SPLIT>; Warm blood<SPLIT>, and mingled brains<SPLIT>, besmear his arms around An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd<SPLIT>, And seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest<SPLIT>.
But good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands<SPLIT>; Bare was his head<SPLIT>, and naked were his hands<SPLIT>, In sign of truce<SPLIT>: then thus he cries aloud<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What sudden rage<SPLIT>, what new desire of blood<SPLIT>, Inflames your alter'd minds<SPLIT>? O Trojans<SPLIT>, cease From impious arms<SPLIT>, nor violate the peace<SPLIT>! By human sanctions<SPLIT>, and by laws divine<SPLIT>, The terms are all agreed<SPLIT>; the war is mine<SPLIT>. Dismiss your fears<SPLIT>, and let the fight ensue<SPLIT>; This hand alone shall right the gods and you<SPLIT>: Our injur'd altars<SPLIT>, and their broken vow<SPLIT>, To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Thus while he spoke<SPLIT>, unmindful of defense<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>winged arrow struck the pious prince<SPLIT>. But<SPLIT>, whether from some human hand it came<SPLIT>, Or hostile god<SPLIT>, is left unknown by fame<SPLIT>: No human hand or hostile god was found<SPLIT>, To boast the triumph of so base a wound<SPLIT>.
When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain<SPLIT>, His chiefs dismay'd<SPLIT>, his troops a fainting train<SPLIT>, Th' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires<SPLIT>: At once his arms and coursers he requires<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, with a leap<SPLIT>, his lofty chariot gains<SPLIT>, And with a ready hand assumes the reins<SPLIT>. He drives impetuous<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, where<SPLIT>'er he goes<SPLIT>, He leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes<SPLIT>. These his lance reaches<SPLIT>; over those he rolls His rapid car<SPLIT>, and crushes out their souls<SPLIT>: In vain the vanquish'd fly<SPLIT>; the victor sends The dead men<SPLIT>'s weapons at their living friends<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, on the banks of Hebrus<SPLIT>' freezing flood<SPLIT>, The God of Battles<SPLIT>, in his angry mood<SPLIT>, Clashing his sword against his brazen shield<SPLIT>, Let loose the reins<SPLIT>, and scours along the field<SPLIT>: Before the wind his fiery coursers fly<SPLIT>; Groans the sad earth<SPLIT>, resounds the rattling sky<SPLIT>. Wrath<SPLIT>, Terror<SPLIT>, Treason<SPLIT>, Tumult<SPLIT>, and Despair (<SPLIT>Dire faces<SPLIT>, and deform'd<SPLIT>) surround the car<SPLIT>; Friends of the god<SPLIT>, and followers of the war<SPLIT>. With fury not unlike<SPLIT>, nor less disdain<SPLIT>, Exulting Turnus flies along the plain<SPLIT>: His smoking horses<SPLIT>, at their utmost speed<SPLIT>, He lashes on<SPLIT>, and urges o<SPLIT>'er the dead<SPLIT>. Their fetlocks run with blood<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, when they bound<SPLIT>, The gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around<SPLIT>. Thamyris and Pholus<SPLIT>, masters of the war<SPLIT>, He kill'd at hand<SPLIT>, but Sthenelus afar<SPLIT>: From far the sons of Imbracus he slew<SPLIT>, Glaucus and Lades<SPLIT>, of the Lycian crew<SPLIT>; Both taught to fight on foot<SPLIT>, in battle join'd<SPLIT>, Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind<SPLIT>.
Meantime Eumedes<SPLIT>, vaunting in the field<SPLIT>, New fir'd the Trojans<SPLIT>, and their foes repell'd<SPLIT>. This son of Dolon bore his grandsire<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>, But emulated more his father<SPLIT>'s fame<SPLIT>; His guileful father<SPLIT>, sent a nightly spy<SPLIT>, The Grecian camp and order to descry<SPLIT>: Hard enterprise<SPLIT>! and well he might require Achilles<SPLIT>' car and horses<SPLIT>, for his hire<SPLIT>: But<SPLIT>, met upon the scout<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' Aetolian prince In death bestow'd a juster recompense<SPLIT>. Fierce Turnus view'd the Trojan from afar<SPLIT>, And launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car<SPLIT>; Then lightly leaping down<SPLIT>, pursued the blow<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe<SPLIT>, Wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword<SPLIT>, And plung'd it in the bosom of its lord<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Possess<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "<SPLIT>the fruit of all thy pains<SPLIT>, And measure<SPLIT>, at thy length<SPLIT>, our Latian plains<SPLIT>. Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand<SPLIT>; Thus may they build their town<SPLIT>, and thus enjoy the land<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
Then Dares<SPLIT>, Butes<SPLIT>, Sybaris he slew<SPLIT>, Whom o<SPLIT>'er his neck his flound<SPLIT>'ring courser threw<SPLIT>. As when loud Boreas<SPLIT>, with his blust<SPLIT>'ring train<SPLIT>, Stoops from above<SPLIT>, incumbent on the main<SPLIT>; Where<SPLIT>'er he flies<SPLIT>, he drives the rack before<SPLIT>, And rolls the billows on th<SPLIT>' Aegaean shore<SPLIT>: So<SPLIT>, where resistless Turnus takes his course<SPLIT>, The scatter'd squadrons bend before his force<SPLIT>; His crest of horses<SPLIT>' hair is blown behind By adverse air<SPLIT>, and rustles in the wind<SPLIT>.
This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, as the chariot roll'd along the plain<SPLIT>, Light from the ground he leapt<SPLIT>, and seiz'd the rein<SPLIT>. Thus hung in air<SPLIT>, he still retain'd his hold<SPLIT>, The coursers frighted<SPLIT>, and their course controll'd<SPLIT>. The lance of Turnus reach'd him as he hung<SPLIT>, And pierc'd his plated arms<SPLIT>, but pass'd along<SPLIT>, And only raz'd the skin<SPLIT>. He turn'd<SPLIT>, and held Against his threat<SPLIT>'ning foe his ample shield<SPLIT>; Then call'd for aid<SPLIT>: but<SPLIT>, while he cried in vain<SPLIT>, The chariot bore him backward on the plain<SPLIT>. He lies revers'd<SPLIT>; the victor king descends<SPLIT>, And strikes so justly where his helmet ends<SPLIT>, He lops the head<SPLIT>. The Latian fields are drunk With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk<SPLIT>.
While he triumphs<SPLIT>, and while the Trojans yield<SPLIT>, The wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field<SPLIT>: Strong Mnestheus<SPLIT>, and Achates often tried<SPLIT>, And young Ascanius<SPLIT>, weeping by his side<SPLIT>, Conduct him to his tent<SPLIT>. Scarce can he rear His limbs from earth<SPLIT>, supported on his spear<SPLIT>. Resolv'd in mind<SPLIT>, regardless of the smart<SPLIT>, He tugs with both his hands<SPLIT>, and breaks the dart<SPLIT>. The steel remains<SPLIT>. No readier way he found To draw the weapon<SPLIT>, than t<SPLIT>' inlarge the wound<SPLIT>. Eager of fight<SPLIT>, impatient of delay<SPLIT>, He begs<SPLIT>; and his unwilling friends obey<SPLIT>.
Iapis was at hand to prove his art<SPLIT>, Whose blooming youth so fir'd Apollo<SPLIT>'s heart<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, for his love<SPLIT>, he proffer'd to bestow His tuneful harp and his unerring bow<SPLIT>. The pious youth<SPLIT>, more studious how to save His aged sire<SPLIT>, now sinking to the grave<SPLIT>, Preferr'd the pow'r of plants<SPLIT>, and silent praise Of healing arts<SPLIT>, before Phoebean bays<SPLIT>.
Propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood<SPLIT>, And heard and saw<SPLIT>, unmov'd<SPLIT>, the mourning crowd<SPLIT>. The fam'd physician tucks his robes around With ready hands<SPLIT>, and hastens to the wound<SPLIT>. With gentle touches he performs his part<SPLIT>, This way and that<SPLIT>, soliciting the dart<SPLIT>, And exercises all his heav'nly art<SPLIT>. All soft<SPLIT>'ning simples<SPLIT>, known of sov'reign use<SPLIT>, He presses out<SPLIT>, and pours their noble juice<SPLIT>. These first infus'd<SPLIT>, to lenify the pain<SPLIT>, He tugs with pincers<SPLIT>, but he tugs in vain<SPLIT>. Then to the patron of his art he pray'd<SPLIT>: The patron of his art refus'd his aid<SPLIT>.
Meantime the war approaches to the tents<SPLIT>; Th' alarm grows hotter<SPLIT>, and the noise augments<SPLIT>: The driving dust proclaims the danger near<SPLIT>; And first their friends<SPLIT>, and then their foes appear<SPLIT>: Their friends retreat<SPLIT>; their foes pursue the rear<SPLIT>. The camp is fill'd with terror and affright<SPLIT>: The hissing shafts within the trench alight<SPLIT>; An undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky<SPLIT>, The shouts of those who kill<SPLIT>, and groans of those who die<SPLIT>.
But now the goddess mother<SPLIT>, mov'd with grief<SPLIT>, And pierc'd with pity<SPLIT>, hastens her relief<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>branch of healing dittany she brought<SPLIT>, Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought<SPLIT>: Rough is the stern<SPLIT>, which woolly leafs surround<SPLIT>; The leafs with flow<SPLIT>'rs<SPLIT>, the flow<SPLIT>'rs with purple crown'd<SPLIT>, Well known to wounded goats<SPLIT>; a sure relief To draw the pointed steel<SPLIT>, and ease the grief<SPLIT>. This Venus brings<SPLIT>, in clouds involv'd<SPLIT>, and brews Th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews<SPLIT>, And odorous panacee<SPLIT>. Unseen she stands<SPLIT>, Temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands<SPLIT>, And pours it in a bowl<SPLIT>, already crown'd With juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound<SPLIT>. The leech<SPLIT>, unknowing of superior art Which aids the cure<SPLIT>, with this foments the part<SPLIT>; And in a moment ceas'd the raging smart<SPLIT>. Stanch'd is the blood<SPLIT>, and in the bottom stands<SPLIT>: The steel<SPLIT>, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands<SPLIT>, Moves up<SPLIT>, and follows of its own accord<SPLIT>, And health and vigor are at once restor'd<SPLIT>. Iapis first perceiv'd the closing wound<SPLIT>, And first the footsteps of a god he found<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Arms<SPLIT>! arms<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" he cries<SPLIT>; "<SPLIT>the sword and shield prepare<SPLIT>, And send the willing chief<SPLIT>, renew'd<SPLIT>, to war<SPLIT>. This is no mortal work<SPLIT>, no cure of mine<SPLIT>, Nor art<SPLIT>'s effect<SPLIT>, but done by hands divine<SPLIT>. Some god our general to the battle sends<SPLIT>; Some god preserves his life for greater ends<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
The hero arms in haste<SPLIT>; his hands infold His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold<SPLIT>: Inflam'd to fight<SPLIT>, and rushing to the field<SPLIT>, That hand sustaining the celestial shield<SPLIT>, This gripes the lance<SPLIT>, and with such vigor shakes<SPLIT>, That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes<SPLIT>. Then with a close embrace he strain'd his son<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, kissing thro<SPLIT>' his helmet<SPLIT>, thus begun<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>My son<SPLIT>, from my example learn the war<SPLIT>, In camps to suffer<SPLIT>, and in fields to dare<SPLIT>; But happier chance than mine attend thy care<SPLIT>! This day my hand thy tender age shall shield<SPLIT>, And crown with honors of the conquer'd field<SPLIT>: Thou<SPLIT>, when thy riper years shall send thee forth To toils of war<SPLIT>, be mindful of my worth<SPLIT>; Assert thy birthright<SPLIT>, and in arms be known<SPLIT>, For Hector<SPLIT>'s nephew<SPLIT>, and Aeneas<SPLIT>' son<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, striding<SPLIT>, issued on the plain<SPLIT>. Anteus and Mnestheus<SPLIT>, and a num<SPLIT>'rous train<SPLIT>, Attend his steps<SPLIT>; the rest their weapons take<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, crowding to the field<SPLIT>, the camp forsake<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around<SPLIT>, Labors beneath their feet the trembling ground<SPLIT>.
Now Turnus<SPLIT>, posted on a hill<SPLIT>, from far Beheld the progress of the moving war<SPLIT>: With him the Latins view'd the cover'd plains<SPLIT>, And the chill blood ran backward in their veins<SPLIT>. Juturna saw th<SPLIT>' advancing troops appear<SPLIT>, And heard the hostile sound<SPLIT>, and fled for fear<SPLIT>. Aeneas leads<SPLIT>; and draws a sweeping train<SPLIT>, Clos'd in their ranks<SPLIT>, and pouring on the plain<SPLIT>. As when a whirlwind<SPLIT>, rushing to the shore From the mid ocean<SPLIT>, drives the waves before<SPLIT>; The painful hind with heavy heart foresees The flatted fields<SPLIT>, and slaughter of the trees<SPLIT>; With like impetuous rage the prince appears Before his doubled front<SPLIT>, nor less destruction bears<SPLIT>. And now both armies shock in open field<SPLIT>; Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill'd<SPLIT>. Archetius<SPLIT>, Ufens<SPLIT>, Epulon<SPLIT>, are slain (<SPLIT>All fam'd in arms<SPLIT>, and of the Latian train<SPLIT>) By Gyas'<SPLIT>, Mnestheus'<SPLIT>, and Achates<SPLIT>' hand<SPLIT>. The fatal augur falls<SPLIT>, by whose command The truce was broken<SPLIT>, and whose lance<SPLIT>, embrued With Trojan blood<SPLIT>, th<SPLIT>' unhappy fight renew'd<SPLIT>. Loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky<SPLIT>, And o<SPLIT>'er the field the frighted Latins fly<SPLIT>. The prince disdains the dastards to pursue<SPLIT>, Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few<SPLIT>; Turnus alone<SPLIT>, amid the dusky plain<SPLIT>, He seeks<SPLIT>, and to the combat calls in vain<SPLIT>. Juturna heard<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, seiz'd with mortal fear<SPLIT>, Forc'd from the beam her brother<SPLIT>'s charioteer<SPLIT>; Assumes his shape<SPLIT>, his armor<SPLIT>, and his mien<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, like Metiscus<SPLIT>, in his seat is seen<SPLIT>.
As the black swallow near the palace plies<SPLIT>; O'er empty courts<SPLIT>, and under arches<SPLIT>, flies<SPLIT>; Now hawks aloft<SPLIT>, now skims along the flood<SPLIT>, To furnish her loquacious nest with food<SPLIT>: So drives the rapid goddess o<SPLIT>'er the plains<SPLIT>; The smoking horses run with loosen'd reins<SPLIT>. She steers a various course among the foes<SPLIT>; Now here<SPLIT>, now there<SPLIT>, her conqu'ring brother shows<SPLIT>; Now with a straight<SPLIT>, now with a wheeling flight<SPLIT>, She turns<SPLIT>, and bends<SPLIT>, but shuns the single fight<SPLIT>. Aeneas<SPLIT>, fir'd with fury<SPLIT>, breaks the crowd<SPLIT>, And seeks his foe<SPLIT>, and calls by name aloud<SPLIT>: He runs within a narrower ring<SPLIT>, and tries To stop the chariot<SPLIT>; but the chariot flies<SPLIT>. If he but gain a glimpse<SPLIT>, Juturna fears<SPLIT>, And far away the Daunian hero bears<SPLIT>.
What should he do<SPLIT>! Nor arts nor arms avail<SPLIT>; And various cares in vain his mind assail<SPLIT>. The great Messapus<SPLIT>, thund<SPLIT>'ring thro<SPLIT>' the field<SPLIT>, In his left hand two pointed jav'lins held<SPLIT>: Encount<SPLIT>'ring on the prince<SPLIT>, one dart he drew<SPLIT>, And with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw<SPLIT>. Aeneas saw it come<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, stooping low Beneath his buckler<SPLIT>, shunn'd the threat<SPLIT>'ning blow<SPLIT>. The weapon hiss'd above his head<SPLIT>, and tore The waving plume which on his helm he wore<SPLIT>. Forced by this hostile act<SPLIT>, and fir'd with spite<SPLIT>, That flying Turnus still declin'd the fight<SPLIT>, The Prince<SPLIT>, whose piety had long repell'd His inborn ardor<SPLIT>, now invades the field<SPLIT>; Invokes the pow'rs of violated peace<SPLIT>, Their rites and injur'd altars to redress<SPLIT>; Then<SPLIT>, to his rage abandoning the rein<SPLIT>, With blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain<SPLIT>.
What god can tell<SPLIT>, what numbers can display<SPLIT>, The various labors of that fatal day<SPLIT>; What chiefs and champions fell on either side<SPLIT>, In combat slain<SPLIT>, or by what deaths they died<SPLIT>; Whom Turnus<SPLIT>, whom the Trojan hero kill'd<SPLIT>; Who shar'd the fame and fortune of the field<SPLIT>! Jove<SPLIT>, could<SPLIT>'st thou view<SPLIT>, and not avert thy sight<SPLIT>, Two jarring nations join'd in cruel fight<SPLIT>, Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite<SPLIT>!
Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found<SPLIT>, Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground<SPLIT>; Betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just<SPLIT>, It reach'd his heart<SPLIT>, nor needs a second thrust<SPLIT>. Now Turnus<SPLIT>, at two blows<SPLIT>, two brethren slew<SPLIT>; First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw<SPLIT>: Then<SPLIT>, leaping on the ground<SPLIT>, on foot assail'd Diores<SPLIT>, and in equal fight prevail'd<SPLIT>. Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place<SPLIT>; Their heads<SPLIT>, distilling gore<SPLIT>, his chariot grace<SPLIT>.
Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw<SPLIT>, Whom without respite at one charge he slew<SPLIT>: Cethegus<SPLIT>, Tanais<SPLIT>, Tagus<SPLIT>, fell oppress'd<SPLIT>, And sad Onythes<SPLIT>, added to the rest<SPLIT>, Of Theban blood<SPLIT>, whom Peridia bore<SPLIT>.
Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore<SPLIT>, And from Apollo<SPLIT>'s fane to battle sent<SPLIT>, O'erthrew<SPLIT>; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent<SPLIT>. Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill'd<SPLIT>, Who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field<SPLIT>: On Lerna<SPLIT>'s lake a silent life he led<SPLIT>, And with his nets and angle earn'd his bread<SPLIT>; Nor pompous cares<SPLIT>, nor palaces<SPLIT>, he knew<SPLIT>, But wisely from th<SPLIT>' infectious world withdrew<SPLIT>: Poor was his house<SPLIT>; his father<SPLIT>'s painful hand Discharg'd his rent<SPLIT>, and plow'd another<SPLIT>'s land<SPLIT>.
As flames among the lofty woods are thrown On diff'rent sides<SPLIT>, and both by winds are blown<SPLIT>; The laurels crackle in the sputt<SPLIT>'ring fire<SPLIT>; The frighted sylvans from their shades retire<SPLIT>: Or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high<SPLIT>; Rapid they run<SPLIT>; the foamy waters fry<SPLIT>; They roll to sea with unresisted force<SPLIT>, And down the rocks precipitate their course<SPLIT>: Not with less rage the rival heroes take Their diff'rent ways<SPLIT>, nor less destruction make<SPLIT>. With spears afar<SPLIT>, with swords at hand<SPLIT>, they strike<SPLIT>; And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike<SPLIT>. Like them<SPLIT>, their dauntless men maintain the field<SPLIT>; And hearts are pierc'd<SPLIT>, unknowing how to yield<SPLIT>: They blow for blow return<SPLIT>, and wound for wound<SPLIT>; And heaps of bodies raise the level ground<SPLIT>.
Murranus<SPLIT>, boasting of his blood<SPLIT>, that springs From a long royal race of Latian kings<SPLIT>, Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown<SPLIT>, Crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone<SPLIT>: Betwixt the wheels he fell<SPLIT>; the wheels<SPLIT>, that bore His living load<SPLIT>, his dying body tore<SPLIT>. His starting steeds<SPLIT>, to shun the glitt<SPLIT>'ring sword<SPLIT>, Paw down his trampled limbs<SPLIT>, forgetful of their lord<SPLIT>.
Fierce Hyllus threaten'd high<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, face to face<SPLIT>, Affronted Turnus in the middle space<SPLIT>: The prince encounter'd him in full career<SPLIT>, And at his temples aim'd the deadly spear<SPLIT>; So fatally the flying weapon sped<SPLIT>, That thro<SPLIT>' his helm it pierc'd his head<SPLIT>. Nor<SPLIT>, Cisseus<SPLIT>, couldst thou scape from Turnus<SPLIT>' hand<SPLIT>, In vain the strongest of th<SPLIT>' Arcadian band<SPLIT>: Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford Availing aid against th<SPLIT>' Aenean sword<SPLIT>, Which to his naked heart pursued the course<SPLIT>; Nor could his plated shield sustain the force<SPLIT>.
Iolas fell<SPLIT>, whom not the Grecian pow'rs<SPLIT>, Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow'rs<SPLIT>, Were doom'd to kill<SPLIT>, while Heav'n prolong'd his date<SPLIT>; But who can pass the bounds<SPLIT>, prefix'd by fate<SPLIT>? In high Lyrnessus<SPLIT>, and in Troy<SPLIT>, he held Two palaces<SPLIT>, and was from each expell'd<SPLIT>: Of all the mighty man<SPLIT>, the last remains A<SPLIT>little spot of foreign earth contains<SPLIT>.
And now both hosts their broken troops unite In equal ranks<SPLIT>, and mix in mortal fight<SPLIT>. Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join The Trojan<SPLIT>, Tuscan<SPLIT>, and Arcadian line<SPLIT>: Sea-born Messapus<SPLIT>, with Atinas<SPLIT>, heads The Latin squadrons<SPLIT>, and to battle leads<SPLIT>. They strike<SPLIT>, they push<SPLIT>, they throng the scanty space<SPLIT>, Resolv'd on death<SPLIT>, impatient of disgrace<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, where one falls<SPLIT>, another fills his place<SPLIT>.
The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son To leave th<SPLIT>' unfinish'd fight<SPLIT>, and storm the town<SPLIT>: For<SPLIT>, while he rolls his eyes around the plain In quest of Turnus<SPLIT>, whom he seeks in vain<SPLIT>, He views th<SPLIT>' unguarded city from afar<SPLIT>, In careless quiet<SPLIT>, and secure of war<SPLIT>. Occasion offers<SPLIT>, and excites his mind To dare beyond the task he first design'd<SPLIT>. Resolv'd<SPLIT>, he calls his chiefs<SPLIT>; they leave the fight<SPLIT>: Attended thus<SPLIT>, he takes a neighb'ring height<SPLIT>; The crowding troops about their gen'ral stand<SPLIT>, All under arms<SPLIT>, and wait his high command<SPLIT>. Then thus the lofty prince<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Hear and obey<SPLIT>, Ye Trojan bands<SPLIT>, without the least delay Jove is with us<SPLIT>; and what I have decreed Requires our utmost vigor<SPLIT>, and our speed<SPLIT>. Your instant arms against the town prepare<SPLIT>, The source of mischief<SPLIT>, and the seat of war<SPLIT>. This day the Latian tow'rs<SPLIT>, that mate the sky<SPLIT>, Shall level with the plain in ashes lie<SPLIT>: The people shall be slaves<SPLIT>, unless in time They kneel for pardon<SPLIT>, and repent their crime<SPLIT>. Twice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain<SPLIT>: Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain<SPLIT>? Your force against the perjur'd city bend<SPLIT>. There it began<SPLIT>, and there the war shall end<SPLIT>. The peace profan'd our rightful arms requires<SPLIT>; Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
He finish'd<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, one soul inspiring all<SPLIT>, Form'd in a wedge<SPLIT>, the foot approach the wall<SPLIT>. Without the town<SPLIT>, an unprovided train Of gaping<SPLIT>, gazing citizens are slain<SPLIT>. Some firebrands<SPLIT>, others scaling ladders bear<SPLIT>, And those they toss aloft<SPLIT>, and these they rear<SPLIT>: The flames now launch'd<SPLIT>, the feather'd arrows fly<SPLIT>, And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky<SPLIT>. Advancing to the front<SPLIT>, the hero stands<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, stretching out to heav'n his pious hands<SPLIT>, Attests the gods<SPLIT>, asserts his innocence<SPLIT>, Upbraids with breach of faith th<SPLIT>' Ausonian prince<SPLIT>; Declares the royal honor doubly stain'd<SPLIT>, And twice the rites of holy peace profan'd<SPLIT>.
Dissenting clamors in the town arise<SPLIT>; Each will be heard<SPLIT>, and all at once advise<SPLIT>. One part for peace<SPLIT>, and one for war contends<SPLIT>; Some would exclude their foes<SPLIT>, and some admit their friends<SPLIT>. The helpless king is hurried in the throng<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, whate<SPLIT>'er tide prevails<SPLIT>, is borne along<SPLIT>. Thus<SPLIT>, when the swain<SPLIT>, within a hollow rock<SPLIT>, Invades the bees with suffocating smoke<SPLIT>, They run around<SPLIT>, or labor on their wings<SPLIT>, Disus'd to flight<SPLIT>, and shoot their sleepy stings<SPLIT>; To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try<SPLIT>; Black vapors<SPLIT>, issuing from the vent<SPLIT>, involve the sky<SPLIT>.
But fate and envious fortune now prepare To plunge the Latins in the last despair<SPLIT>. The queen<SPLIT>, who saw the foes invade the town<SPLIT>, And brands on tops of burning houses thrown<SPLIT>, Cast round her eyes<SPLIT>, distracted with her fear- No troops of Turnus in the field appear<SPLIT>. Once more she stares abroad<SPLIT>, but still in vain<SPLIT>, And then concludes the royal youth is slain<SPLIT>. Mad with her anguish<SPLIT>, impotent to bear The mighty grief<SPLIT>, she loathes the vital air<SPLIT>. She calls herself the cause of all this ill<SPLIT>, And owns the dire effects of her ungover<SPLIT>n'd will<SPLIT>; She raves against the gods<SPLIT>; she beats her breast<SPLIT>; She tears with both her hands her purple vest<SPLIT>: Then round a beam a running noose she tied<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, fasten'd by the neck<SPLIT>, obscenely died<SPLIT>.
Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown<SPLIT>, And to her dames and to her daughter known<SPLIT>, The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair And rosy cheeks<SPLIT>; the rest her sorrow share<SPLIT>: With shrieks the palace rings<SPLIT>, and madness of despair<SPLIT>. The spreading rumor fills the public place<SPLIT>: Confusion<SPLIT>, fear<SPLIT>, distraction<SPLIT>, and disgrace<SPLIT>, And silent shame<SPLIT>, are seen in ev'ry face<SPLIT>. Latinus tears his garments as he goes<SPLIT>, Both for his public and his private woes<SPLIT>; With filth his venerable beard besmears<SPLIT>, And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs<SPLIT>. And much he blames the softness of his mind<SPLIT>, Obnoxious to the charms of womankind<SPLIT>, And soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd<SPLIT>; To break the solemn league so long desir'd<SPLIT>, Nor finish what his fates<SPLIT>, and those of Troy<SPLIT>, requir'd<SPLIT>.
Now Turnus rolls aloof o<SPLIT>'er empty plains<SPLIT>, And here and there some straggling foes he gleans<SPLIT>. His flying coursers please him less and less<SPLIT>, Asham'd of easy fight and cheap success<SPLIT>. Thus half-contented<SPLIT>, anxious in his mind<SPLIT>, The distant cries come driving in the wind<SPLIT>, Shouts from the walls<SPLIT>, but shouts in murmurs drown'd<SPLIT>; A<SPLIT>jarring mixture<SPLIT>, and a boding sound<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Alas<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" said he<SPLIT>, "what mean these dismal cries<SPLIT>? What doleful clamors from the town arise<SPLIT>?<SPLIT>" Confus'd<SPLIT>, he stops<SPLIT>, and backward pulls the reins<SPLIT>. She who the driver<SPLIT>'s office now sustains<SPLIT>, Replies<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Neglect<SPLIT>, my lord<SPLIT>, these new alarms<SPLIT>; Here fight<SPLIT>, and urge the fortune of your arms<SPLIT>: There want not others to defend the wall<SPLIT>. If by your rival<SPLIT>'s hand th<SPLIT>' Italians fall<SPLIT>, So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress<SPLIT>, In honor equal<SPLIT>, equal in success<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
To this<SPLIT>, the prince<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O sister<SPLIT>- for I knew The peace infring'd proceeded first from you<SPLIT>; I<SPLIT>knew you<SPLIT>, when you mingled first in fight<SPLIT>; And now in vain you would deceive my sight<SPLIT>- Why<SPLIT>, goddess<SPLIT>, this unprofitable care<SPLIT>? Who sent you down from heav'n<SPLIT>, involv'd in air<SPLIT>, Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain<SPLIT>, And see your brother bleeding on the plain<SPLIT>? For to what pow'r can Turnus have recourse<SPLIT>, Or how resist his fate<SPLIT>'s prevailing force<SPLIT>? These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground<SPLIT>: Mighty the man<SPLIT>, and mighty was the wound<SPLIT>. I<SPLIT>heard my dearest friend<SPLIT>, with dying breath<SPLIT>, My name invoking to revenge his death<SPLIT>. Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place<SPLIT>, To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace<SPLIT>. On earth supine<SPLIT>, a manly corpse he lies<SPLIT>; His vest and armor are the victor<SPLIT>'s prize<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, shall I see Laurentum in a flame<SPLIT>, Which only wanted<SPLIT>, to complete my shame<SPLIT>? How will the Latins hoot their champion<SPLIT>'s flight<SPLIT>! How Drances will insult and point them to the sight<SPLIT>! Is death so hard to bear<SPLIT>? Ye gods below<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Since those above so small compassion show<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame<SPLIT>, Which not belies my great forefather<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>"
He said<SPLIT>; and while he spoke<SPLIT>, with flying speed Came Sages urging on his foamy steed<SPLIT>: Fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, seeking Turnus<SPLIT>, sent his voice before<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Turnus<SPLIT>, on you<SPLIT>, on you alone<SPLIT>, depends Our last relief<SPLIT>: compassionate your friends<SPLIT>! Like lightning<SPLIT>, fierce Aeneas<SPLIT>, rolling on<SPLIT>, With arms invests<SPLIT>, with flames invades the town<SPLIT>: The brands are toss'd on high<SPLIT>; the winds conspire To drive along the deluge of the fire<SPLIT>. All eyes are fix'd on you<SPLIT>: your foes rejoice<SPLIT>; Ev'n the king staggers<SPLIT>, and suspends his choice<SPLIT>; Doubts to deliver or defend the town<SPLIT>, Whom to reject<SPLIT>, or whom to call his son<SPLIT>. The queen<SPLIT>, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd<SPLIT>, Herself suborning death<SPLIT>, has breath'd her last<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is true<SPLIT>, Messapus<SPLIT>, fearless of his fate<SPLIT>, With fierce Atinas<SPLIT>' aid<SPLIT>, defends the gate<SPLIT>: On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe<SPLIT>, The more they kill<SPLIT>, the greater numbers grow<SPLIT>; An iron harvest mounts<SPLIT>, and still remains to mow<SPLIT>. You<SPLIT>, far aloof from your forsaken bands<SPLIT>, Your rolling chariot drive o<SPLIT>'er empty sands<SPLIT>.
Stupid he sate<SPLIT>, his eyes on earth declin'd<SPLIT>, And various cares revolving in his mind<SPLIT>: Rage<SPLIT>, boiling from the bottom of his breast<SPLIT>, And sorrow mix'd with shame<SPLIT>, his soul oppress'd<SPLIT>; And conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought<SPLIT>, And love by jealousy to madness wrought<SPLIT>. By slow degrees his reason drove away The mists of passion<SPLIT>, and resum'd her sway<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, rising on his car<SPLIT>, he turn'd his look<SPLIT>, And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke<SPLIT>. A<SPLIT>wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd<SPLIT>, Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd<SPLIT>; And bridges laid above to join the space<SPLIT>, And wheels below to roll from place to place<SPLIT>. "<SPLIT>Sister<SPLIT>, the Fates have vanquish'd<SPLIT>: let us go The way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show<SPLIT>. The fight is fix'd<SPLIT>; nor shall the branded name Of a base coward blot your brother<SPLIT>'s fame<SPLIT>. Death is my choice<SPLIT>; but suffer me to try My force<SPLIT>, and vent my rage before I die<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, leaping down without delay<SPLIT>, Thro<SPLIT>' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way<SPLIT>. Striding he pass'd<SPLIT>, impetuous as the wind<SPLIT>, And left the grieving goddess far behind<SPLIT>. As when a fragment<SPLIT>, from a mountain torn By raging tempests<SPLIT>, or by torrents borne<SPLIT>, Or sapp'd by time<SPLIT>, or loosen'd from the roots<SPLIT>- Prone thro<SPLIT>' the void the rocky ruin shoots<SPLIT>, Rolling from crag to crag<SPLIT>, from steep to steep; Down sink<SPLIT>, at once<SPLIT>, the shepherds and their sheep<SPLIT>: Involv'd alike<SPLIT>, they rush to nether ground<SPLIT>; Stunn'd with the shock they fall<SPLIT>, and stunn'd from earth rebound<SPLIT>: So Turnus<SPLIT>, hasting headlong to the town<SPLIT>, Should<SPLIT>'ring and shoving<SPLIT>, bore the squadrons down<SPLIT>. Still pressing onward<SPLIT>, to the walls he drew<SPLIT>, Where shafts<SPLIT>, and spears<SPLIT>, and darts promiscuous flew<SPLIT>, And sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue<SPLIT>. First stretching out his arm<SPLIT>, in sign of peace<SPLIT>, He cries aloud<SPLIT>, to make the combat cease<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Rutulians<SPLIT>, hold<SPLIT>; and Latin troops<SPLIT>, retire<SPLIT>! The fight is mine<SPLIT>; and me the gods require<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is just that I should vindicate alone The broken truce<SPLIT>, or for the breach atone<SPLIT>. This day shall free from wars th<SPLIT>' Ausonian state<SPLIT>, Or finish my misfortunes in my fate<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Both armies from their bloody work desist<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, bearing backward<SPLIT>, form a spacious list<SPLIT>. The Trojan hero<SPLIT>, who receiv'd from fame The welcome sound<SPLIT>, and heard the champion<SPLIT>'s name<SPLIT>, Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls<SPLIT>, Greedy of war where greater glory calls<SPLIT>. He springs to fight<SPLIT>, exulting in his force His jointed armor rattles in the course<SPLIT>. Like Eryx<SPLIT>, or like Athos<SPLIT>, great he shows<SPLIT>, Or Father Apennine<SPLIT>, when<SPLIT>, white with snows<SPLIT>, His head divine obscure in clouds he hides<SPLIT>, And shakes the sounding forest on his sides<SPLIT>. The nations<SPLIT>, overaw'd<SPLIT>, surcease the fight<SPLIT>; Immovable their bodies<SPLIT>, fix'd their sight<SPLIT>. Ev'n death stands still<SPLIT>; nor from above they throw Their darts<SPLIT>, nor drive their batt<SPLIT>'ring-rams below<SPLIT>. In silent order either army stands<SPLIT>, And drop their swords<SPLIT>, unknowing<SPLIT>, from their hands<SPLIT>. Th' Ausonian king beholds<SPLIT>, with wond<SPLIT>'ring sight<SPLIT>, Two mighty champions match'd in single fight<SPLIT>, Born under climes remote<SPLIT>, and brought by fate<SPLIT>, With swords to try their titles to the state<SPLIT>.
Now<SPLIT>, in clos'd field<SPLIT>, each other from afar They view<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, rushing on<SPLIT>, begin the war<SPLIT>. They launch their spears<SPLIT>; then hand to hand they meet<SPLIT>; The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet<SPLIT>: Their bucklers clash<SPLIT>; thick blows descend from high<SPLIT>, And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly<SPLIT>. Courage conspires with chance<SPLIT>, and both ingage With equal fortune yet<SPLIT>, and mutual rage<SPLIT>. As when two bulls for their fair female fight In Sila<SPLIT>'s shades<SPLIT>, or on Taburnus<SPLIT>' height<SPLIT>; With horns adverse they meet<SPLIT>; the keeper flies<SPLIT>; Mute stands the herd<SPLIT>; the heifers roll their eyes<SPLIT>, And wait th<SPLIT>' event<SPLIT>; which victor they shall bear<SPLIT>, And who shall be the lord<SPLIT>, to rule the lusty year<SPLIT>: With rage of love the jealous rivals burn<SPLIT>, And push for push<SPLIT>, and wound for wound return<SPLIT>; Their dewlaps gor'd<SPLIT>, their sides are lav'd in blood<SPLIT>; Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro<SPLIT>' the wood<SPLIT>: Such was the combat in the listed ground<SPLIT>; So clash their swords<SPLIT>, and so their shields resound<SPLIT>.
Jove sets the beam<SPLIT>; in either scale he lays The champions<SPLIT>' fate<SPLIT>, and each exactly weighs<SPLIT>. On this side<SPLIT>, life and lucky chance ascends<SPLIT>; Loaded with death<SPLIT>, that other scale descends<SPLIT>. Rais'd on the stretch<SPLIT>, young Turnus aims a blow Full on the helm of his unguarded foe<SPLIT>: Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side<SPLIT>, As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide<SPLIT>. But all in pieces flies the traitor sword<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, in the middle stroke<SPLIT>, deserts his lord<SPLIT>. Now is but death<SPLIT>, or flight<SPLIT>; disarm'd he flies<SPLIT>, When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies<SPLIT>. Fame says that Turnus<SPLIT>, when his steeds he join'd<SPLIT>, Hurrying to war<SPLIT>, disorder'd in his mind<SPLIT>, Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T was not the fated sword his father bore<SPLIT>, But that his charioteer Metiscus wore<SPLIT>. This<SPLIT>, while the Trojans fled<SPLIT>, the toughness held<SPLIT>; But<SPLIT>, vain against the great Vulcanian shield<SPLIT>, The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand<SPLIT>: The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand<SPLIT>.
Surpris'd with fear<SPLIT>, he fled along the field<SPLIT>, And now forthright<SPLIT>, and now in orbits wheel'd<SPLIT>; For here the Trojan troops the list surround<SPLIT>, And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground<SPLIT>. Aeneas hastens<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' with heavier pace<SPLIT>- His wound<SPLIT>, so newly knit<SPLIT>, retards the chase<SPLIT>, And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse<SPLIT>- Yet<SPLIT>, pressing foot by foot<SPLIT>, his foe pursues<SPLIT>.
Thus<SPLIT>, when a fearful stag is clos'd around With crimson toils<SPLIT>, or in a river found<SPLIT>, High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears<SPLIT>, Still opening<SPLIT>, following still<SPLIT>, where<SPLIT>'er he steers<SPLIT>; The persecuted creature<SPLIT>, to and fro<SPLIT>, Turns here and there<SPLIT>, to scape his Umbrian foe<SPLIT>: Steep is th<SPLIT>' ascent<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, if he gains the land<SPLIT>, The purple death is pitch'd along the strand<SPLIT>. His eager foe<SPLIT>, determin'd to the chase<SPLIT>, Stretch'd at his length<SPLIT>, gains ground at ev'ry pace<SPLIT>; Now to his beamy head he makes his way<SPLIT>, And now he holds<SPLIT>, or thinks he holds<SPLIT>, his prey<SPLIT>: Just at the pinch<SPLIT>, the stag springs out with fear<SPLIT>; He bites the wind<SPLIT>, and fills his sounding jaws with air<SPLIT>: The rocks<SPLIT>, the lakes<SPLIT>, the meadows ring with cries<SPLIT>; The mortal tumult mounts<SPLIT>, and thunders in the skies<SPLIT>. Thus flies the Daunian prince<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, flying<SPLIT>, blames His tardy troops<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, calling by their names<SPLIT>, Demands his trusty sword<SPLIT>. The Trojan threats The realm with ruin<SPLIT>, and their ancient seats To lay in ashes<SPLIT>, if they dare supply With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy<SPLIT>: Thus menacing<SPLIT>, he still pursues the course<SPLIT>, With vigor<SPLIT>, tho<SPLIT>' diminish'd of his force<SPLIT>. Ten times already round the listed place One chief had fled<SPLIT>, and t<SPLIT>' other giv'n the chase<SPLIT>: No trivial prize is play'd<SPLIT>; for on the life Or death of Turnus now depends the strife<SPLIT>.
Within the space<SPLIT>, an olive tree had stood<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>sacred shade<SPLIT>, a venerable wood<SPLIT>, For vows to Faunus paid<SPLIT>, the Latins<SPLIT>' guardian god<SPLIT>. Here hung the vests<SPLIT>, and tablets were ingrav'd<SPLIT>, Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd<SPLIT>. With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree<SPLIT>, To make the ground inclos'd for combat free<SPLIT>. Deep in the root<SPLIT>, whether by fate<SPLIT>, or chance<SPLIT>, Or erring haste<SPLIT>, the Trojan drove his lance<SPLIT>; Then stoop'd<SPLIT>, and tugg'd with force immense<SPLIT>, to free Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree<SPLIT>; That<SPLIT>, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain<SPLIT>, His flying weapon might from far attain<SPLIT>.
Confus'd with fear<SPLIT>, bereft of human aid<SPLIT>, Then Turnus to the gods<SPLIT>, and first to Faunus pray'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>O Faunus<SPLIT>, pity<SPLIT>! and thou Mother Earth<SPLIT>, Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth<SPLIT>, Hold fast the steel<SPLIT>! If my religious hand Your plant has honor'd<SPLIT>, which your foes profan'd<SPLIT>, Propitious hear my pious pray<SPLIT>'r<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" He said<SPLIT>, Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid<SPLIT>. Th' incumbent hero wrench'd<SPLIT>, and pull'd<SPLIT>, and strain'd<SPLIT>; But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd<SPLIT>. Juturna took her time<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, while in vain He strove<SPLIT>, assum'd Meticus<SPLIT>' form again<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, in that imitated shape<SPLIT>, restor'd To the despairing prince his Daunian sword<SPLIT>. The Queen of Love<SPLIT>, who<SPLIT>, with disdain and grief<SPLIT>, Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief<SPLIT>, T' assert her offspring with a greater deed<SPLIT>, From the tough root the ling<SPLIT>'ring weapon freed<SPLIT>.
Once more erect<SPLIT>, the rival chiefs advance<SPLIT>: One trusts the sword<SPLIT>, and one the pointed lance<SPLIT>; And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance<SPLIT>.
Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke<SPLIT>, Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What new arrest<SPLIT>, O Queen of Heav'n<SPLIT>, is sent To stop the Fates now lab'ring in th<SPLIT>' event<SPLIT>? What farther hopes are left thee to pursue<SPLIT>? Divine Aeneas<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>and thou know<SPLIT>'st it too<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) Foredoom'd<SPLIT>, to these celestial seats are due<SPLIT>. What more attempts for Turnus can be made<SPLIT>, That thus thou ling<SPLIT>'rest in this lonely shade<SPLIT>? Is it becoming of the due respect And awful honor of a god elect<SPLIT>, A<SPLIT>wound unworthy of our state to feel<SPLIT>, Patient of human hands and earthly steel<SPLIT>? Or seems it just<SPLIT>, the sister should restore A<SPLIT>second sword<SPLIT>, when one was lost before<SPLIT>, And arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror<SPLIT>? For what<SPLIT>, without thy knowledge and avow<SPLIT>, Nay more<SPLIT>, thy dictate<SPLIT>, durst Juturna do<SPLIT>? At last<SPLIT>, in deference to my love<SPLIT>, forbear To lodge within thy soul this anxious care<SPLIT>; Reclin'd upon my breast<SPLIT>, thy grief unload<SPLIT>: Who should relieve the goddess<SPLIT>, but the god<SPLIT>? Now all things to their utmost issue tend<SPLIT>, Push'd by the Fates to their appointed While leave was giv'n thee<SPLIT>, and a lawful hour For vengeance<SPLIT>, wrath<SPLIT>, and unresisted pow'r<SPLIT>, Toss'd on the seas<SPLIT>, thou couldst thy foes distress<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, driv'n ashore<SPLIT>, with hostile arms oppress<SPLIT>; Deform the royal house<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, from the side Of the just bridegroom<SPLIT>, tear the plighted bride<SPLIT>: Now cease at my command<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" The Thund<SPLIT>'rer said<SPLIT>; And<SPLIT>, with dejected eyes<SPLIT>, this answer Juno made<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>Because your dread decree too well I knew<SPLIT>, From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew<SPLIT>. Else should you not behold me here<SPLIT>, alone<SPLIT>, Involv'd in empty clouds<SPLIT>, my friends bemoan<SPLIT>, But<SPLIT>, girt with vengeful flames<SPLIT>, in open sight Engag'd against my foes in mortal fight<SPLIT>. '<SPLIT>T is true<SPLIT>, Juturna mingled in the strife By my command<SPLIT>, to save her brother<SPLIT>'s life<SPLIT>- At least to try<SPLIT>; but<SPLIT>, by the Stygian lake<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>The most religious oath the gods can take<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) With this restriction<SPLIT>, not to bend the bow<SPLIT>, Or toss the spear<SPLIT>, or trembling dart to throw<SPLIT>. And now<SPLIT>, resign'd to your superior might<SPLIT>, And tir'd with fruitless toils<SPLIT>, I loathe the fight<SPLIT>. This let me beg (<SPLIT>and this no fates withstand<SPLIT>) Both for myself and for your father<SPLIT>'s land<SPLIT>, That<SPLIT>, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace<SPLIT>, (<SPLIT>Which I<SPLIT>, since you ordain<SPLIT>, consent to bless<SPLIT>,<SPLIT>) The laws of either nation be the same<SPLIT>; But let the Latins still retain their name<SPLIT>, Speak the same language which they spoke before<SPLIT>, Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore<SPLIT>. Call them not Trojans<SPLIT>: perish the renown And name of Troy<SPLIT>, with that detested town<SPLIT>. Latium be Latium still<SPLIT>; let Alba reign And Rome<SPLIT>'s immortal majesty remain<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
Then thus the founder of mankind replies (<SPLIT>Unruffled was his front<SPLIT>, serene his eyes<SPLIT>) "<SPLIT>Can Saturn<SPLIT>'s issue<SPLIT>, and heav'n<SPLIT>'s other heir<SPLIT>, Such endless anger in her bosom bear<SPLIT>? Be mistress<SPLIT>, and your full desires obtain<SPLIT>; But quench the choler you foment in vain<SPLIT>. From ancient blood th<SPLIT>' Ausonian people sprung<SPLIT>, Shall keep their name<SPLIT>, their habit<SPLIT>, and their tongue<SPLIT>. The Trojans to their customs shall be tied<SPLIT>: I<SPLIT>will<SPLIT>, myself<SPLIT>, their common rites provide<SPLIT>; The natives shall command<SPLIT>, the foreigners subside<SPLIT>. All shall be Latium<SPLIT>; Troy without a name<SPLIT>; And her lost sons forget from whence they came<SPLIT>. From blood so mix'd<SPLIT>, a pious race shall flow<SPLIT>, Equal to gods<SPLIT>, excelling all below<SPLIT>. No nation more respect to you shall pay<SPLIT>, Or greater off'rings on your altars lay<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" Juno consents<SPLIT>, well pleas'd that her desires Had found success<SPLIT>, and from the cloud retires<SPLIT>.
The peace thus made<SPLIT>, the Thund<SPLIT>'rer next prepares To force the wat<SPLIT>'ry goddess from the wars<SPLIT>. Deep in the dismal regions void of light<SPLIT>, Three daughters at a birth were born to Night<SPLIT>: These their brown mother<SPLIT>, brooding on her care<SPLIT>, Indued with windy wings to flit in air<SPLIT>, With serpents girt alike<SPLIT>, and crown'd with hissing hair<SPLIT>. In heav'n the Dirae call'd<SPLIT>, and still at hand<SPLIT>, Before the throne of angry Jove they stand<SPLIT>, His ministers of wrath<SPLIT>, and ready still The minds of mortal men with fears to fill<SPLIT>, Whene<SPLIT>'er the moody sire<SPLIT>, to wreak his hate On realms or towns deserving of their fate<SPLIT>, Hurls down diseases<SPLIT>, death and deadly care<SPLIT>, And terrifies the guilty world with war<SPLIT>. One sister plague if these from heav'n he sent<SPLIT>, To fright Juturna with a dire portent<SPLIT>. The pest comes whirling down<SPLIT>: by far more slow Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow<SPLIT>, Or Cydon yew<SPLIT>, when<SPLIT>, traversing the skies<SPLIT>, And drench'd in pois'nous juice<SPLIT>, the sure destruction flies<SPLIT>. With such a sudden and unseen a flight Shot thro<SPLIT>' the clouds the daughter of the night<SPLIT>. Soon as the field inclos'd she had in view<SPLIT>, And from afar her destin'd quarry knew<SPLIT>, Contracted<SPLIT>, to the boding bird she turns<SPLIT>, Which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns<SPLIT>, And beats about the tombs with nightly wings<SPLIT>, Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings<SPLIT>. Thus lessen'd in her form<SPLIT>, with frightful cries The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies<SPLIT>, Flaps on his shield<SPLIT>, and flutters o<SPLIT>'er his eyes<SPLIT>.
A<SPLIT>lazy chillness crept along his blood<SPLIT>; Chok'd was his voice<SPLIT>; his hair with horror stood<SPLIT>. Juturna from afar beheld her fly<SPLIT>, And knew th<SPLIT>' ill omen<SPLIT>, by her screaming cry And stridor of her wings<SPLIT>. Amaz'd with fear<SPLIT>, Her beauteous breast she beat<SPLIT>, and rent her flowing hair<SPLIT>.
"<SPLIT>Ah me<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" she cries<SPLIT>, "in this unequal strife What can thy sister more to save thy life<SPLIT>? Weak as I am<SPLIT>, can I<SPLIT>, alas<SPLIT>! contend In arms with that inexorable fiend<SPLIT>? Now<SPLIT>, now<SPLIT>, I quit the field<SPLIT>! forbear to fright My tender soul<SPLIT>, ye baleful birds of night<SPLIT>; The lashing of your wings I know too well<SPLIT>, The sounding flight<SPLIT>, and fun'ral screams of hell<SPLIT>! These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove<SPLIT>, The worthy recompense of ravish'd love<SPLIT>! Did he for this exempt my life from fate<SPLIT>? O<SPLIT>hard conditions of immortal state<SPLIT>, Tho<SPLIT>' born to death<SPLIT>, not privileg'd to die<SPLIT>, But forc'd to bear impos'd eternity<SPLIT>! Take back your envious bribes<SPLIT>, and let me go Companion to my brother<SPLIT>'s ghost below<SPLIT>! The joys are vanish'd<SPLIT>: nothing now remains<SPLIT>, Of life immortal<SPLIT>, but immortal pains<SPLIT>. What earth will open her devouring womb<SPLIT>, To rest a weary goddess in the tomb<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" She drew a length of sighs<SPLIT>; nor more she said<SPLIT>, But in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head<SPLIT>, Then plung'd into her stream<SPLIT>, with deep despair<SPLIT>, And her last sobs came bubbling up in air<SPLIT>.
Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear Against his foe<SPLIT>, and thus upbraids his fear<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>What farther subterfuge can Turnus find<SPLIT>? What empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind<SPLIT>? '<SPLIT>T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight<SPLIT>; Not with their feet<SPLIT>, but hands<SPLIT>, the valiant fight<SPLIT>. Vary thy shape in thousand forms<SPLIT>, and dare What skill and courage can attempt in war<SPLIT>; Wish for the wings of winds<SPLIT>, to mount the sky<SPLIT>; Or hid<SPLIT>, within the hollow earth to lie<SPLIT>!<SPLIT>" The champion shook his head<SPLIT>, and made this short reply<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>No threats of thine my manly mind can move<SPLIT>; '<SPLIT>T is hostile heav'n I dread<SPLIT>, and partial Jove<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He said no more<SPLIT>, but<SPLIT>, with a sigh<SPLIT>, repress'd The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast<SPLIT>.
Then<SPLIT>, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around<SPLIT>, An antique stone he saw<SPLIT>, the common bound Of neighb'ring fields<SPLIT>, and barrier of the ground<SPLIT>; So vast<SPLIT>, that twelve strong men of modern days Th' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise<SPLIT>. He heav'd it at a lift<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, pois'd on high<SPLIT>, Ran stagg<SPLIT>'ring on against his enemy<SPLIT>, But so disorder'd<SPLIT>, that he scarcely knew His way<SPLIT>, or what unwieldly weight he threw<SPLIT>. His knocking knees are bent beneath the load<SPLIT>, And shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood<SPLIT>. The stone drops from his arms<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, falling short For want of vigor<SPLIT>, mocks his vain effort<SPLIT>. And as<SPLIT>, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight<SPLIT>, The sickly fancy labors in the night<SPLIT>; We seem to run<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, destitute of force<SPLIT>, Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course<SPLIT>: In vain we heave for breath<SPLIT>; in vain we cry<SPLIT>; The nerves<SPLIT>, unbrac'd<SPLIT>, their usual strength deny<SPLIT>; And on the tongue the falt<SPLIT>'ring accents die<SPLIT>: So Turnus far'd<SPLIT>; whatever means he tried<SPLIT>, All force of arms and points of art employ'd<SPLIT>, The Fury flew athwart<SPLIT>, and made th<SPLIT>' endeavor void<SPLIT>.
A<SPLIT>thousand various thoughts his soul confound<SPLIT>; He star'd about<SPLIT>, nor aid nor issue found<SPLIT>; His own men stop the pass<SPLIT>, and his own walls surround<SPLIT>. Once more he pauses<SPLIT>, and looks out again<SPLIT>, And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain<SPLIT>. Trembling he views the thund<SPLIT>'ring chief advance<SPLIT>, And brandishing aloft the deadly lance<SPLIT>: Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe<SPLIT>, Forgets to ward<SPLIT>, and waits the coming blow<SPLIT>. Astonish'd while he stands<SPLIT>, and fix'd with fear<SPLIT>, Aim'd at his shield he sees th<SPLIT>' impending spear<SPLIT>.
The hero measur'd first<SPLIT>, with narrow view<SPLIT>, The destin'd mark<SPLIT>; and<SPLIT>, rising as he threw<SPLIT>, With its full swing the fatal weapon flew<SPLIT>. Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls<SPLIT>, Or stones from batt<SPLIT>'ring-engines break the walls<SPLIT>: Swift as a whirlwind<SPLIT>, from an arm so strong<SPLIT>, The lance drove on<SPLIT>, and bore the death along<SPLIT>. Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail<SPLIT>, Nor aught<SPLIT>, beneath his arms<SPLIT>, the coat of mail<SPLIT>: It pierc'd thro<SPLIT>' all<SPLIT>, and with a grisly wound Transfix'd his thigh<SPLIT>, and doubled him to ground<SPLIT>. With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky<SPLIT>: Woods<SPLIT>, hills<SPLIT>, and valleys<SPLIT>, to the voice reply<SPLIT>.
Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid<SPLIT>, With eyes cast upward<SPLIT>, and with arms display'd<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, recreant<SPLIT>, thus to the proud victor pray'd<SPLIT>: "<SPLIT>I know my death deserv'd<SPLIT>, nor hope to live<SPLIT>: Use what the gods and thy good fortune give<SPLIT>. Yet think<SPLIT>, O think<SPLIT>, if mercy may be shown<SPLIT>- Thou hadst a father once<SPLIT>, and hast a son<SPLIT>- Pity my sire<SPLIT>, now sinking to the grave<SPLIT>; And for Anchises<SPLIT>' sake old Daunus save<SPLIT>! Or<SPLIT>, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death<SPLIT>, Give to my friends my body void of breath<SPLIT>! The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life<SPLIT>; Thine is the conquest<SPLIT>, thine the royal wife<SPLIT>: Against a yielded man<SPLIT>, 't is mean ignoble strife<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>"
In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand<SPLIT>, And<SPLIT>, just prepar'd to strike<SPLIT>, repress'd his hand<SPLIT>. He roll'd his eyes<SPLIT>, and ev'ry moment felt His manly soul with more compassion melt<SPLIT>; When<SPLIT>, casting down a casual glance<SPLIT>, he spied The golden belt that glitter'd on his side<SPLIT>, The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore From dying Pallas<SPLIT>, and in triumph wore<SPLIT>. Then<SPLIT>, rous'd anew to wrath<SPLIT>, he loudly cries (<SPLIT>Flames<SPLIT>, while he spoke<SPLIT>, came flashing from his eyes<SPLIT>) "<SPLIT>Traitor<SPLIT>, dost thou<SPLIT>, dost thou to grace pretend<SPLIT>, Clad<SPLIT>, as thou art<SPLIT>, in trophies of my friend<SPLIT>? To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go<SPLIT>! '<SPLIT>T is Pallas<SPLIT>, Pallas gives this deadly blow<SPLIT>.<SPLIT>" He rais'd his arm aloft<SPLIT>, and<SPLIT>, at the word<SPLIT>, Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword<SPLIT>. The streaming blood distain'd his arms around<SPLIT>, And the disdainful soul came rushing thro<SPLIT>' the wound<SPLIT>.
